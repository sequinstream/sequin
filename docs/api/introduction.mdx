You'll use Sequin's **API** to [receive](/api/http-pull-consumers/receive), [acknowledge](/api/http-pull-consumers/ack), and [`nack`](/api/http-pull-consumers/nack) messages from Sequin's HTTP Pull Consumers.

<Note>
  We're working on providing consumer CRUD operations in the API as well.

## Retrieve your API token

Sequin automatically creates an API token for you when you create an account. We display your API token when you create an HTTP Pull Consumer. Here is how to find it:

1. Log in to the console and create or navigate to an HTTP Pull Consumer.
2. In the **Request and Acknowledge Messages** section, you'll see API documentation for the consumer. Click the **eye icon** to reveal your API token.
