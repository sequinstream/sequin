To start streaming changes from your Postgres database, connect Sequin to your database.

This guide is for a **vanilla Postgres database**, such as one you run locally or host yourself on a cloud provider. If you're using a database provider, see the setup guide for your database provider:

- [AWS RDS](/how-to/setup-rds)
- [GCP Cloud SQL](/how-to/setup-gcp)
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](/how-to/setup-azure)
- [Neon](/how-to/setup-neon)
- [Supabase](/how-to/setup-supabase)

## Prerequisites

If you're running Sequin locally, be sure to [install and configure Sequin](/running-sequin) first.

You'll need permission to create publications and replication slots on your database. You may also need administration privileges on your database if logical replication is not configured (more below).

### Provision a Postgres user for Sequin

<CreateSequinDbUser />

## Enable logical replication

Sequin uses logical replication to capture changes from your Postgres database.

To find out if logical replication is enabled on your database, connect to your database and run the following SQL command:

```sql
show wal_level;
```

The `wal_level` must be set to `logical`.

If it's not, you'll need to enable it. Note that this requires a restart of your database.

Follow these steps to enable logical replication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate your postgresql.conf file">
    The location varies by platform:

    - Linux: Usually in `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf`
    - macOS (Homebrew): `/usr/local/var/postgresql@<version>/postgresql.conf`
    - Windows: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\postgresql.conf`

    You can also find it by running:

    ```sql
    show config_file;
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit postgresql.conf">
    Open postgresql.conf in your text editor and set:

    ```
    wal_level = logical
    ```

    If you can't find the `wal_level` setting, add it at the end of the file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart PostgreSQL">
    Restart PostgreSQL to apply the changes:

    **Linux**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart postgresql
    ```

    **macOS**:
    ```bash
    brew services restart postgresql@<version>
    ```

    **Windows**:
    ```bash
    net stop postgresql
    net start postgresql
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

After restarting, run the `show wal_level;` command again to verify the change took effect.

## Connect Sequin to your database

In the Sequin Console, navigate to the "Databases" tab and click "Connect Database".

### Database connection details

Fill in the connection details for your database:

- **Host**: The host address of your database.
- **Port**: The port number of your database.
- **Database**: The name of your database.
- **Username**: The username Sequin will use to connect to your database.
- **Password**: The password Sequin will use to connect to your database.

### (Sequin Cloud) Connect to local database

If you're using Sequin Cloud, you can connect Sequin to a database running on your local machine.

Click "Use localhost" and follow the instructions. The "Host" and "Port" fields will be disabled.

You'll need the [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) installed to use this method.

### Replication configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Slot name and publication name">
    Fill in the "Slot name" and "Publication name" that you'd like Sequin to use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create slot and publication">
    Follow the instructions to create the slot and publication on your database.

    The simplest publication is one that includes all tables:

    ```sql
    create publication sequin_pub for all tables with (publish_via_partition_root = true);
    ```

    However, you can also create a publication that includes specific tables or schemas. You'll just need to [modify the publication](#adding-tables-to-your-publication) as needed in the future.

     <Warning>
      Be sure to create the publication _before_ you create the slot.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Test and connect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test connection">
    Click "Test connection" to verify that Sequin can connect to your database.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect">
    Once the test goes green, click "Connect" to finish the connection process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring

Sequin will run health checks against your database connection automatically. You can view the status of the connection at any time in your database's "Overview" page.

## Adding tables to your publication

If you created a publication that contained a subset of your tables, you can add more tables to the publication later.

To add tables to an existing publication, use the `alter publication` command:

```sql
alter publication sequin_pub add table table1, table2;
```

You can also add all tables in a specific schema:

```sql
alter publication sequin_pub add all tables in schema my_schema;
```

To verify which tables are included in your publication, you can run:

```sql
select * from pg_publication_tables
where pubname = 'sequin_pub';
```
