A **stream** is a table of messages. When you send a message to Sequin, it is stored in a stream. [Consumers](#consumers) are how you read messages from the stream with delivery guarantees.

If you're just starting out, using a single stream for all your data is sufficient. You'll use separate streams when you want to have different policies for a set of messages. They can also be helpful when scaling, as each stream is a separate Postgres table under the hood.

To add a stream to Sequin, run:

```bash
sequin stream add [<stream>] [<flags>]
```

## Stream basics

Below are some of the most common stream actions. For a complete list of available stream actions, see `sequin stream --help`:

```bash
sequin stream --help
usage: sequin stream <command> [<args> ...]

Stream related commands

Subcommands:
  stream ls    List streams
  stream info  Show stream info
  stream add   Add a new stream
  stream rm    Remove a stream
  stream send  Send a message to a stream
  stream view  View messages in a stream

Global Flags:
  -h, --help             Show context-sensitive help
      --version          Show application version.
      --context=CONTEXT  Use a specific context
      --[no-]as-curl     Output the command as a curl request instead of executing it
```

### Sending messages

You can send a message to Sequin by specifying the `key` and the `data` payload:

```bash
sequin message send [stream] [key] [data]
```

For example:

```bash
sequin message send default orders.cus_a.ord_1jNsd '{ "quantity": 4 }'
```

When sending via HTTP, `messages` can contain a list of 1 or more messages:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' -d '{"messages":[{"data":"{ \"quantity\": 4 }","key":"orders.cus_a.ord_1jNsd"}, {"data":"{ \"quantity\": 4 }","key":"orders.cus_a.ord_1jNsd"}]}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
'https://[sequin-base-url]/api/streams/68658e3e-de48-4005-a5de-2a7cd6868d80/messages'
```

The maximum batch size per send request is 10,000 messages. We generally recommend smaller batch sizes if each message is large. Keeping the entire batch to under ~10MB is usually a good rule in most cases.

### Viewing messages

View a message or messages in a stream with `view`:

```bash
sequin stream view [stream] [--filter=<pattern>] [--last=<N>] [--first=<N>] [--table]
```

For example, this `view` command will show the last 10 messages that have a key that starts with `orders.cus_a`:

```bash
sequin stream view default --filter=orders.cus_a.> --last=10
```

As an HTTP request:


Or with HTTP:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://[sequin-base-url]/api/streams/default/messages?limit=10&sort=seq_desc&key_pattern=orders.cus_a.>' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

### Observe

Sequin's `observe` is a powerful tool for seeing the state of a stream, its messages, and its consumers. Open `observe` to a particular stream:

```bash
sequin observe --stream=[stream]
```

### Policies

Streams can be configured with a number of different policies that affect message processing and retention:

#### `one-message-per-key=[<bool>]`

When `one-message-per-key` is set to `true`, Sequin places a unique constraint on message's `key`. All messages will be upserted. There will only ever be one message with a given key in the stream, the last message with that key received.

This setting is a great fit for processing records where only the latest version of a message matters to your system.

#### `dedupe=[<bool>]`

Must be used in combination with `one-message-per-key=true` and defaults to `true`. When `dedupe` is `true`, a stream will ignore messages that (1) have a key that matches an existing message in the stream and (2) are unchanged (according to a SHA256 hash of `data`). This saves the stream from re-inserting the message and all consumers from re-processing it.

You can set this setting to `false` if you want messages to be reprocessed by consumers, even if their contents haven't changed. This can be useful for processing command messages, where the contents don't change but you still want your system to reprocess them.

#### `max-storage=[<gigabytes>]gb`

The approximate maximum storage (in gigabytes) that a stream can expand to.

When a stream hits `max-storage`, messages will be evicted oldest-first, respecting `retain-at-least`.

Postgres' analytics around storage are approximate, so we recommend ensuring a 20% buffer. i.e. if you set a stream's `max-storage` to 100GB, you should ensure that your Postgres volume is able to accommodate a 120GB stream.

#### `retain-up-to=[<duration>]`

Messages that are older than `duration` will be evicted from the stream.

#### `retain-at-least=[<duration>]`

Must be used in combination with `max-storage`. `retain-at-least` is a safety mechanism. It ensures that if a stream hits `max-storage`, Sequin will never evict messages younger than `retain-at-least`. You can set `retain-at-least=infinite` to ensure nothing is evicted.

If a stream hits `max-storage` but can no longer evict messages according to `retain-at-least`, it will stop receiving messages.

It can be a good idea to set `retain-at-least` if you're setting `max-storage`. If your stream starts growing unexpectedly, the combination of these two settings can act as a failsafe.
