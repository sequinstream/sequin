[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) are serverless functions that run on Cloudflare's global network.

Often, you want to trigger a Cloudflare Worker when a database row changes. For example, you may want to trigger a worker as a side-effect of a database change, or fan out work to multiple services.

In this guide, you will learn how to setup Sequin to trigger a Cloudflare Worker when a database row changes.

## Prerequisites

You are about to create a simple Cloudflare Worker that logs a message to the console. You'll trigger this worker by setting up a Webhook sink in Sequin that sends a HTTP POST request to the worker's URL with the payload of the database row that changed.

You'll need the following:

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?utm_source=sequin.com)
- Sequin [installed locally](/quickstart/webhooks) or a [Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com/register).
- A [database](/connect-postgres) connected to Sequin

## Create a Cloudflare Worker

Start by creating a new Cloudflare Worker that takes in a Sequin change event as a payload and logs the payload to the console.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create a new Cloudflare Worker">
      1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to the "Workers and Pages" section.
      2. Click on "Create Worker".
      3. Give your service a name (e.g., "user-worker") and click "Deploy".

      Cloudflare will create a new worker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add worker code">
      Click the **Edit code** button.

      Replace the default code in the worker editor with the following:

      ```javascript
      export default {
        async fetch(request, env) {
          // Verify the Sequin webhook secret
          const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
          if (!authHeader || authHeader !== `Bearer ${env.SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET}`) {
            return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
          }

          try {
            const payload = await request.json();
            const { record } = payload;

            if (record && record.name) {
              console.log(`Hello ${record.name}`);
            } else {
              console.log('No name found in the payload.');
            }

            return new Response('Success', { status: 200 });
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error processing request:', error);
            return new Response('Internal Server Error', { status: 500 });
          }
        },
      };
      ```

      This worker first checks the authorization header to make sure the request is coming from Sequin. Then it processes the [payload](/reference/sinks/webhooks#request-format) and logs a message to the console. In this example code, the row that changed contains a `name` field, so the worker logs the name to the console.

      Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your worker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable">
      1. In your worker's settings, go to the "Settings" tab.
      2. Scroll down to the "Variables and Secrets" section.
      3. Click "+ Add".
      4. Set the variable name as `SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and the value to a [secure secret](/reference/sinks/webhooks#authentication) of your choice.
      5. Click "Deploy".

      Keep this secret handy. You will need to use this secret value in the Sequin dashboard when you create the push consumer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the worker's URL">
      Under the "Settings" tab, find the "Domains & Routes" section.

      Copy the worker's URL. You will need this URL in the Sequin dashboard when you create the push consumer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You've successfully created a Cloudflare Worker that logs a message to the console when Sequin sends a HTTP POST request to the worker's URL.
</Check>

## Create a webhook sink

Create a webhook sink that captures changes to your database and sends a HTTP POST request to the Cloudflare Worker's URL:

<Steps titleSize="h3">


    <Step title="Create a new sink">
        Navigate to the "Sinks" tab, click the "Create Sink" button, and select "Webhook Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select source table(s)">
        Select the table or schema you want to capture changes from (i.e `public.users` or `public`).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose message type">
        Specify whether you want to receive changes from the table. See [payloads](/reference/payloads) for details.

        <Tip>
        If you're not sure which to choose, leave the default setting of "Changes". Changes are a better fit for event-driven use cases, like triggering workflows, which is usually what you want to do with webhooks.
        </Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Specify change types">
        If you selected changes, in "Records to process", you can indicate whether you want to receive `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` changes. Select all three for now. No need to add a filter.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure backfill">
        You can optionally indicate if you want your webhook endpoint to receive a [backfill](reference/backfills) of all or a portion of the table's existing data. For now, leave "Backfill" toggled off.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure message grouping">
        Under "Message grouping", leave the default option selected to ensure events for the same row are sent to your webhook endpoint in order.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure sink settings">
        Under "Webhook Sink configuration" leave the defaults:

        - Leave the default value of `30000 ms` for "Request timeout" as this is more than enough time for your worker to process the request
        - Leave the default value of `1` for "Batch size" so each change is processed individually.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure HTTP endpoint">
        Under "HTTP Endpoint", enter the Cloudflare Worker's URL you copied earlier. Then click to "Add Encrypted Header" with the key `Authorization` and the value `Bearer SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, using the secret value you set in your worker's environment variables.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Name and create sink">
        Give your sink a name (i.e. `users_webhook_sink`) and click "Create Webhook Sink".
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
    Your webhook sink is now created and ready to send events to your Cloudflare Worker.
</Check>

## Test end-to-end
<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create a row in your database">

    For example, insert a row into the `users` table:

    ```sql
    insert into
    users (name)
    values
      (
        'John Doe'
      );
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trace the change in the Sequin dashboard">
    In the Sequin console, open the **Messages** tab on your webhook sink and confirm that a message was delivered.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Confirm the event was received by your Cloudflare Worker">
    1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to your worker.
    2. Click on the "Logs" tab.
    3. You should see a log entry. For example:`Hello John Doe`:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/guides/cloudflare/logs.png" alt="Confirm message" />
    </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You've successfully triggered a Cloudflare Worker from a database change!
</Check>

## Next steps

Modify this example to suit your needs:

- If you need to run long-running jobs, consider using [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects/) in tandem with Workers.
- Tune your webhook sink configuration to suit your volume of work.
- Implement additional security measures, such as [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/) for enhanced authentication and authorization.
