This guide provides step-by-step instructions to connect your [GCP Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) database to Sequin.

## Enable logical replication on GCP Cloud SQL

By default, logical replication is not enabled on GCP Cloud SQL. To enable it, follow these steps:

<Warning>Enabling replication requires a restart of your database instance.</Warning>

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Grant replication permissions">
    Connect to your database and run the following SQL command to grant replication permissions to your user:

    ```sql
    ALTER USER [username] WITH REPLICATION;
    ```

    Replace `[username]` with the database user you want to use for replication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable pglogical flag">
    In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to your Cloud SQL instance and follow these steps:

    1. Go to the **Configuration** tab for your database instance
    2. Click **Edit configuration**
    3. Under **Flags** section, add a new flag: `cloudsql.enable_pglogical=on`
    4. Click **Save** to apply the changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart your database instance">
    After setting the flag, you need to restart your Cloud SQL instance for the changes to take effect. In the Google Cloud Console:

    1. Go to the **Overview** tab of your Cloud SQL instance
    2. Click the **Restart** button at the top of the page
    3. Confirm the restart when prompted
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect Sequin to your GCP Cloud SQL database

After enabling logical replication on GCP Cloud SQL, you'll now connect to your database in Sequin.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enter connection details in Sequin">
    In the Sequin Console, click on the **Connect Database** button and enter the credentials for your GCP Cloud SQL database:

    <Note>
      You can find these connection details in your GCP Cloud SQL instance overview.
    </Note>

    - **Host**: Your Cloud SQL instance IP address
    - **Port**: 5432 (default Postgres port)
    - **Database**: Your database name
    - **Username**: Your database username (with replication permissions)
    - **Password**: The password for your database user

    Make sure to enable the **SSL** option for secure connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a replication slot">
    Connect to your database using the SQL client of your choice and execute the following SQL query to create a replication slot:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
    ```

    This creates a replication slot named `sequin_slot`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a publication">
    Next, create a publication to indicate which tables will publish changes to the replication slot. Run the following SQL command:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR TABLE table1, table2, table3;
    ```

    If you want to publish changes from all tables, you can use:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the replication slot details in Sequin">
    Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`) you just created. Then, name your database and click **Create Database**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a consumer

With your GCP Cloud SQL database connected to Sequin via a replication slot and publication, Sequin is now detecting changes to your tables. Now create a consumer to process your data changes and send them to your application.

Click the **Add a consumer** button and select your GCP Cloud SQL database as the source. Follow the instructions in our [quickstart guide](/quickstart) to complete the process.

## Next steps

With your GCP Cloud SQL database connected to Sequin, you can now:

* Set up filters to capture specific changes.
* Use Sequin's observability features to monitor and debug your data flows.
* Explore Sequin's replay and backfill features for historical data processing.

For more information on these features, check out our [core concepts](/core-concepts) documentation.
