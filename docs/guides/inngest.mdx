[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) is a serverless jobs queue. You write and test functions locally in your project, and then deploy them to Inngest where they reliably invoke the functions you write. Inngest handles the infrastructure, observability, and execution.

Often, you want to trigger Inngest events when a record in your database is created, updated, or deleted. For instance, you might want to send a welcome email to a user as soon as they are inserted into the database:

</Frame>

In this guide, you'll learn how to use a Sequin webhook sink to trigger Inngest events from database changes.

## Prerequisites

You are about to create a local Inngest function that sends a welcome email to a user as soon as they are inserted into the database. Sequin ensures that every new user `insert` triggers an Inngest event that your function can then process (i.e. exactly once processing guarantee).

You'll need the following:

- An JavaScript/TypeScript project with [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) installed
<Tip>
If you don't have one already, follow [Inngest's Next.js quickstart guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/getting-started/nextjs-quick-start#before-you-start-choose-a-project) to setup your project. You can return to this guide when you're ready to write your first Inngest function.
</Tip>
- Sequin [installed locally](/quickstart/webhooks) or a [Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com/register).
- A [database](/connect-postgres) connected to Sequin

## Create an Inngest function

Start by creating a new Inngest function. The example below shows a function that sends a welcome email to a user when a `webhook/user.inserted` event is received.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create a new function">
  In your `functions.ts` file (typically located in `src/inngest/functions.ts`), create a new function:

  ```ts
    import { inngest } from "./client";

    export const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
        { id: "send-welcome-email" },
        { event: "webhook/users.insert" },
        async ({ event }) => {
            const user = event.data;
            //function to send welcome email
            return { event, body: `Welcome email sent to ${user.email} with subject "Hi ${user.name}"` };
        },
    );
    ```

    This function takes the `webhook/users.insert` event as input, extracts the user data, and sends a welcome email to the user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the function to `Inngest.serve()`">
  The `Inngest.serve()` handler registers your function with Inngest so it can invoke the function.

  In your route.ts file (typically located in `src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`) register the function you created above:

  ```ts
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";
  import { sendWelcomeEmail } from "../../../inngest/functions";

  export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [sendWelcomeEmail],
  });
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger the function with a test event">
    Test the `sendWelcomeEmail` function by trigger a test eveng in the Inngest development server:

    1. Run your Next.js project and Start the Inngest development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # in a new terminal, start the inngest development server
        npx inngest-cli@latest dev
        ```
    2. Open the Inngest dashboard in your browser and navigate to the ["Functions"](http://localhost:8288/functions) tab.
    3. You should see the `send-welcome-email` function. Click the "Invoke" button and enter a sample event payload. For this example, use the following event payload:
        ```json
        {
            "data": {
                "name": "John Doe",
                "email": "john.doe@example.com"
            }
        }
        ```
    4. Click the "Invoke Function" button and then navigate to the "Runs" tab. You should see the run you just triggered:

    </Frame>


  </Step>
</Steps>


<Check>
    You've successfully created an Inngest function that sends a welcome email to a user when a `webhook/users.insert` event is received. In the next step, you'll trigger this event with Webhook.
</Check>

## Create an Inngest webhook

Now, create an Inngest trigger that invokes the function you created above:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create a new webhook in the Inngest dashboard">
        In the Inngest Cloud Dashboard, navigate to the ["Webhooks"](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/manage/webhooks) tab and click the "Create Webhook" button.

        <Note>
        Copy the webhook URL. You'll provide this URL to Sequin when you create a consumer below.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Transform the Sequin payload into an Inngest event">
    Sequin will send a [payload](/reference/sinks/webhooks#request-format) to your webhook containing the database change:

    ```json
    {
      "data:" [
        {
          "record": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com"
          },
          "changes": null,
          "action": "insert",
          "metadata": {
            "table_schema": "public",
            "table_name": "users",
            "commit_timestamp": "2024-02-20T14:30:00.127470Z",
            "consumer": {
              "id": "e2f9a3b1-7c6d-4b5a-9f8e-1d2c3b4a5e6f",
              "name": "new_user_consumer"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    You need to transform this payload into an Inngest event that triggers your function. To do so, use a "Transform" to extract the the event name and data from the Sequin payload:

    ```ts
    function transform(evt, headers = {}, queryParams = {}) {
      return {
        // Rename this webhook to give the events a unique name,
        // or use a field from the incoming event as the event name.
        name: `webhook/${evt.metadata.table_name}.${evt.data[0].action}`,
        data: evt.data[0].record,
      };
    };
    ```

    This will create an Inngest event with the name of the table and the action (i.e. `webhook/users.insert`) and the data from the `record` field in the payload:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/guides/inngest/create-webhook.png" alt="Transform Event" />
    </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
    You've successfully created a webhook endpoint that transforms Sequin payloads into Inngest events. In the next steps, you'll configure a webhook sink to send events to your webhook.
</Check>

## Create a webhook sink

Create a webhook sink that captures changes to your database and sends a HTTP POST request to the Inngest webhook URL:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create a new sink">
        Navigate to the "Sinks" tab, click the "Create Sink" button, and select "Webhook Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select source table">
        Select the table you want to capture changes from (i.e `public.users`).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose message type">
        Specify whether you want to receive [changes](/reference/payloads) from the table.

        <Tip>
        If you're not sure which to choose, leave the default setting of "Changes". So far in this guide, you've been setting up Inngest to handle change payloads from Sequin.
        </Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Specify change types">
        If you selected changes, in "Records to process", you can indicate whether you want to receive `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` changes.

        In this example, you want to send welcome emails to new users, so under "Records to process" select only `insert` changes. No need to add a filter.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure backfill">
        You can optionally indicate if you want your webhook endpoint to receive a [backfill](reference/backfills) of all or a portion of the table's existing data. For now, leave "Backfill" toggled off.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure message grouping">
        Under "Message grouping", leave the default option selected to ensure events for the same row are sent to your webhook endpoint in order.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure sink settings">
        Under "Webhook Sink configuration" leave the defaults:

        - Leave the default value of `30000 ms` for "Request timeout" as this is more than enough time for Inngest to process the request
        - Leave the default value of `1` for "Batch size" so each change is processed individually.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure HTTP endpoint">
        Under "HTTP Endpoint", enter the webhook URL you created in Inngest as the base URL. No additional headers are needed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Name and create sink">
        Give your sink a name (i.e. `new_user_webhook_sink`) and click "Create Webhook Sink".
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
    Your webhook sink is now created and ready to send events to Inngest.
</Check>

## Test end-to-end

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create a new user in your database">
    Insert a new row into your database. For example, a new user:

    ```sql
    insert into users (name, email) values ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Trace the change in the Sequin dashboard">
    In the Sequin web console, navigate to the "messages" tab for your webhook sinks and confirm that Sequin delivered the event to Inngest.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Confirm the event in the Inngest dashboard">
    In the Inngest Cloud dashboard, navigate to the ["Events"](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/events) tab, select your event (i.e., `webhook/users.insert`), and open the "Logs" tab. You should see the event you just created:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/guides/inngest/inngest-log.png" alt="Event log" />
    </Frame>

    Now, click the "Send to Dev Server" button to forward the event to your local Inngest development server.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Forward the event to your local Inngest development server">
    Finally, in your local Inngest development server, navigate to the "Runs" tab and confirm that the event was received and your function was invoked:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/guides/inngest/confirm-function-run.png" alt="Event run" />
    </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
    You've successfully created a complete workflow that captures changes from your database, triggers an Inngest event, and invokes your function.
</Check>

## Next steps
From here you can tailor your Sequin webhook sink and Inngest functions to cover more use cases. Then deploy your Inngest functions to production. Here are some resources to help:

- Tailor your [Sequin webhook sink](/reference/sinks/webhooks) to your use case.
- [Deploy](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/deployment) your Inngest functions to production.
- Make your Inngest functions more [robust](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/error-handling) with retries, timeouts, and other features.
