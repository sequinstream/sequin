## Connect Sequin to your Neon database

After enabling logical replication on Neon, you'll now connect to your Neon database in Sequin.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enter connection details in Sequin">
    In the Sequin Console, click on the **Connect Database** button and enter the following details for your Neon database:

    <Note>
      You can find these connection details in your Neon project dashboard under the "Connection details" section:
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/guides/neon/neon-connection-details.png" alt="Neon connection details" />
      </Frame>
    </Note>

    - **Host**: Your Neon host (e.g., `ep-cool-snow-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`)
    - **Port**: 5432 (default Postgres port)
    - **Database**: Your database name
    - **Username**: Your Neon username
    - **Password**: Your Neon password

    Make sure to enable the **SSL** option for secure connection.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a replication slot">
    Use the **SQL Editor** in your Neon project to execute the following SQL query to create a replication slot:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
    ```

    This creates a replication slot named `sequin_slot`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a publication">
    Next, create a publication to indicate which tables will publish changes to the replication slot. Run the following SQL command:

        ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR TABLE table1, table2, table3;
    ```

    If you want to publish changes from all tables, you can use:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the replication slot details in Sequin">
    Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`) you just created. Then, name your database and click **Create Database**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a consumer

With your Neon database connected to Sequin via a replication slot and publication, Sequin is now detecting changes to your tables. Now create a consumer to process your data changes and send them to your application.

Click the **Add a consumer** button and select your Neon database as the source. Follow the instructions in our [quickstart guide](/quickstart) to complete the process.

## Next steps

With your Neon database connected to Sequin, you can now:

* Set up filters to capture specific changes.
* Use Sequin's observability features to monitor and debug your data flows.
* Explore Sequin's replay and backfill features for historical data processing.
