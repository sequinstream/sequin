[Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) is a powerful real-time analytics platform built on ClickHouse. It allows you to ingest, transform, and query large volumes of data with low latency.

Often, you want to stream changes from your Postgres database to Tinybird for real-time analytics. For instance, you might want to analyze order data as it's created or updated in your database:

In this guide, you'll learn how to use Sequin to stream Postgres changes to Tinybird in real-time.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need:

- A [Sequin](https://console.sequinstream.com/register) account
- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- A Postgres database (Sequin works with any Postgres database version 12 and up)

## Connect Sequin to your database

First, you'll need to connect Sequin to your Postgres database:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Add a new database in Sequin">
    1. Log in to your Sequin account and click the **Add New Database** button.
    2. Enter the connection details for your Postgres database.
    3. Follow the instructions to create a publication and a replication slot by running two SQL commands in your database:
    ```sql
    create publication sequin_pub for all tables;
    select pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
    ```
    4. Name your database and click the **Connect Database** button.

    Sequin will connect to your database and ensure that it's configured properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  You've successfully connected Sequin to your Postgres database. In the next step, you'll set up Tinybird to receive data from Sequin.
</Check>

## Setup a Tinybird Event URL

Now, you'll create a Data Source in Tinybird that will receive the data from Sequin:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create a Data Source in Tinybird">
    1. Log in to your Tinybird account and open the **Data Sources** tab.
    2. Click on **Create Data Source**.
    3. Choose **Events API** as the source type.
    5. Copy the endpoint URL and Authorization header. You'll need this in the next step.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  You've created a Data Source in Tinybird that's ready to receive data. Next, you'll configure Sequin to send data to this endpoint.
</Check>

## Create Sequin HTTP Endpoint

Now, you'll create an HTTP endpoint in Sequin that will send data to the Tinybird Event URL you created in the previous step:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create an HTTP Endpoint in Sequin">
    1. In the Sequin console, navigate to the **HTTP Endpoints** tab.
    2. Click on **Create HTTP Endpoint**.
    3. Name your endpoint (e.g., "tinybird_endpoint").
    4. Paste the Tinybird endpoint URL you copied earlier into the **Base URL** field.
    5. Add an encrypted header:
       - Key: `Authorization`
       - Value: `Bearer YOUR_TINYBIRD_TOKEN`
    6. Click **Create HTTP Endpoint**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  You've set up an HTTP endpoint in Sequin that will securely send data to Tinybird. In the final step, you'll create a consumer to capture database changes and send them to this endpoint.
</Check>

## Create Sequin Consumer

Finally, you'll create a Sequin consumer to capture changes from your database and send them to Tinybird:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create a Push Consumer in Sequin">
    1. In the Sequin console, navigate to the **Consumers** tab.
    2. Click on **Create Consumer**.
    3. Select the table you want to stream (e.g., "orders").
    4. Choose to process **Rows**. This will capture all inserts and updates.
    <Info>
      You can also choose to process **Changes** instead of rows. This will capture changes to the table, such as inserts, updates, and deletes.
    </Info>
    5. Select a column to sort by.
    6. Choose **Push** as the consumer type.
    7. Select the HTTP endpoint you created in the previous step.
    8. Name your consumer and click **Create Consumer**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Congratulations! You've set up a complete pipeline to stream changes from your Postgres database to Tinybird in real-time.
</Check>

## Test the Integration

To test your integration:

1. Insert or update some data in your Postgres database.
2. Check the Sequin **Trace** tab to confirm that the changes were captured and sent to Tinybird.
3. In Tinybird, query your Data Source to see the new data.

## Next Steps

Now that you have real-time data flowing from Postgres to Tinybird, you can:

- Create Pipes in Tinybird to transform and analyze your data.
- Set up API endpoints in Tinybird to query your data.
- Use Tinybird's dashboard features to visualize your data in real-time.

By combining the transactional power of Postgres with the analytical capabilities of Tinybird, you've created a powerful real-time data pipeline for your application.
