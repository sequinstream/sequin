Webhooks are a convenient way for your users to subscribe to data changes in your application. But creating a robust webhook system that can reliably deliver every change, handle errors, and scale to millions of messages per day is not an easy task.

Sequin's [webhook sinks](/reference/sinks/webhooks) combined with Sequin's [Management API](/management-api/introduction) give you the tools to build a user-facing webhook system that is reliable and feature rich:

- Capture and deliver every change that happens in Postgres to your users
- Customizable filters so users can subscribe to only the data they care about
- Backfill support so users can catch up on missed data
- Automatic retries and backoff
- Monitoring and alerting via Prometheus and Grafana

In this tutorial, you'll build a simple Node.js application that allows users to subscribe to webhooks for their own data. You'll use the Management API to dynamically create HTTP endpoints and webhook sinks that are specific to each user. You'll also learn how [backfills](/reference/backfills) and [transforms](/reference/transforms) can be used to enable more complex use cases. Then, you'll see how you can monitor the health of the system using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Prerequisites
- Sequin [installed and running locally](/running-sequin)
- A Postgres database [connected to Sequin](/connect-postgres)
- Node.js [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your machine (if you want to [run the code examples](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/tree/main/examples/user-specific-webhooks))

## Retrieve your API token

To interact with the Management API, you'll need an [API token](/management-api/authentication):

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Log in to the Sequin console">
        With Sequin running, log in to the Sequin console at https://localhost:7376.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to the accounts page">
        Click the "Settings" gear icon in the bottom left corner and select "Manage Account".
    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy your API key">
        In the API tokens section, copy the API token to your clipboard.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup your database tables

In the [Postgres database connected to Sequin](/connect-postgres), create a table containing data you want to send to users. For this tutorial, we'll work with a simple schema with three tables:

    - `users`: The list of users that can subscribe to webhooks.
    - `notifications`: Notifications that are sent to users. This is an example of the kinds of data you might want to send to users.
    - `webhook_subscriptions`: This table tracks the webhook subscriptions for each user. In this case, it'll store the webhook URL and the Sequin sink ID for each subscription.

```sql
-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Create notifications table (each notification belongs to a user)
CREATE TABLE notifications (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
message TEXT NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create webhook_subscriptions table (tracks user webhooks)
CREATE TABLE webhook_subscriptions (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
endpoint TEXT NOT NULL,           -- the webhook URL
sequin_sink_id UUID NOT NULL,     -- ID of the Sequin sink for this subscription
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

Now, insert a user to work with:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Paul');
```

## Build the webhook subscription system

With the infrastructure in place, you'll build a Node.js application that exposes an endpoint to create a webhook subscription for a user. You'll use Express for the webserver, node-postgres (`pg`) to connect to the database you just configured, and Axios to interact with the Management API.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Initialize the project">
        1. Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it:

        ```bash
        mkdir user-webhooks
        cd user-webhooks
        ```

        2. Initialize the project with Express:

        ```bash
        npm init -y
        npm install --save express pg axios
        ```

        3. Create a new file called `server.js`:

        ```bash
        touch server.js
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Write the server code">
        Add the following code to the `server.js` file:

        ```js server.js
        const express = require("express");
        const axios = require("axios");
        const { Pool } = require("pg");

        const app = express();
        app.use(express.json()); // Enable JSON body parsing

        // Configuration â€“ replace with your actual API token:
        const SEQUIN_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"; // (e.g., the token you copied from the console)
        const SEQUIN_API_BASE = "http://localhost:7376/api";
        const PORT = 3333; // Port number for the Express server

        // Postgres connection to your local database
        const dbPool = new Pool({
            connectionString: "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres", // Replace with your database connection string
        });

        // Endpoint to subscribe a user to webhook notifications
        app.post("/subscribe", async (req, res) => {
            const { userId, webhookUrl } = req.body;
            if (!userId || !webhookUrl) {
                return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing userId or webhookUrl" });
            }
            try {
                // 1. Create a new HTTP endpoint in Sequin for the given webhook URL
                const endpointName = `user-${userId}-endpoint`;
                let endpointResp;
                try {
                    endpointResp = await axios.post(
                        `${SEQUIN_API_BASE}/destinations/http_endpoints`,
                        {
                            name: endpointName,
                            url: webhookUrl,
                        },
                        {
                            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${SEQUIN_API_TOKEN}` },
                        }
                    );
                } catch (err) {
                    if (err.response?.status === 401) {
                        throw new Error('Invalid API token');
                    } else if (err.response?.status === 400) {
                        throw new Error(`Invalid request: ${err.response.data.message}`);
                    } else {
                        throw new Error(`Failed to create HTTP endpoint: ${err.message}`);
                    }
                }

                if (!endpointResp?.data?.id) {
                    throw new Error('Failed to get endpoint ID from response');
                }

                const endpointId = endpointResp.data.id;
                console.log(
                    `Created HTTP endpoint (${endpointName}) with ID = ${endpointId}`
                );

                // 2. Create a new webhook sink for the notifications table, filtered to this user
                const sinkName = `user-${userId}-notifications`;
                let sinkResp;
                try {
                    sinkResp = await axios.post(
                        `${SEQUIN_API_BASE}/sinks`,
                        {
                            name: sinkName,
                            status: "active",
                            database: "postgres", // source database name. Make sure this matches the name you provided in the Sequin console when you connected your database.
                            table: "public.notifications", // source table to watch. Note that Sequin requires the schema name in the table name.
                            filters: [
                                // filter to only stream this user's rows
                                {
                                    column_name: "user_id",
                                    operator: "=",
                                    comparison_value: userId.toString(),
                                },
                            ],
                            destination: {
                                type: "webhook",
                                http_endpoint: endpointName, // reference the HTTP endpoint by name
                                http_endpoint_path: "",
                            },
                            // (By default, the sink will capture new inserts/updates/deletes in real-time)
                            actions: ["insert", "update", "delete"],
                        },
                        {
                            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${SEQUIN_API_TOKEN}` },
                        }
                    );
                } catch (err) {
                    if (err.response?.status === 401) {
                        throw new Error('Invalid API token');
                    } else if (err.response?.status === 400) {
                        throw new Error(`Invalid sink configuration: ${err.response.data.message}`);
                    } else {
                        throw new Error(`Failed to create sink: ${err.message}`);
                    }
                }

                if (!sinkResp?.data?.id) {
                    throw new Error('Failed to get sink ID from response');
                }

                const sinkId = sinkResp.data.id;
                console.log(`Created webhook sink (${sinkName}) with ID = ${sinkId}`);

                // 3. Save the subscription details in the database
                await dbPool.query(
                    "INSERT INTO webhook_subscriptions(user_id, endpoint, sequin_sink_id) VALUES($1, $2, $3)",
                    [userId, webhookUrl, sinkId]
                );

                res.json({ message: "Webhook subscription created", sinkId });
            } catch (err) {
                console.error(
                    "Error creating subscription:",
                    err.response?.data || err.message
                );
                return res
                    .status(500)
                    .json({ error: "Failed to create webhook subscription" });
            }
        });

        // Start the Express server
        app.listen(PORT, () => {
            console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
        });
        ```

        Stepping through this code:
        - You standup a simple Express app that can connect to your local postgres database and make requests to the Sequin Management API.
        - You define a `/subscribe` endpoint that allows a user to create a new webhook subscription by providing a webhook URL and a user ID.
           - The function calls the Management API to create a new HTTP endpoint using the webhook URL provided in the request.
           - Then it creates a new webhook sink for the notifications table, filtered to the provided user.
           - Finally, it saves the subscription details to your local postgres database.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test your webhook subscription system">
        1. Run the server:

            ```bash
            node server.js
            ```

        2. Create a test webhook URL to receive notifications. We suggest using [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to easily inspect the incoming requests.

        3. In a new terminal, make a POST request to the `/subscribe` endpoint to create a new webhook subscription:

            ```bash
            curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/subscribe -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": 1, "webhookUrl": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"}'
            ```

        4. In the terminal running your server, you should see the following output:

            ```
            Created HTTP endpoint (user-1-endpoint) with ID = <endpoint_id>
            Created webhook sink (user-1-notifications) with ID = <sink_id>
            ```

            You can confirm that the subscription was created by checking your `webhook_subscriptions` table in postgres as well.

        5. Now, insert a new notification into the `notifications` table in your database:

            ```sql
            INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, message) VALUES (1, 'Hello from Sequin');
            ```

        6. You should see the notification appear in your test webhook:

            ```json
            {
                "data": [
                    {
                    "record": {
                        "created_at": "2025-04-22T00:26:11.975318Z",
                        "id": 1,
                        "message": "Hello from Sequin",
                        "user_id": 1
                    },
                    "metadata": {
                        "consumer": {
                        "id": "4538acb2-8fb2-485f-885f-b0a0a8ad8e29",
                        "name": "user-1-notifications"
                        },
                        "table_name": "notifications",
                        "commit_timestamp": "2025-04-22T00:26:11.975318Z",
                        "transaction_annotations": null,
                        "table_schema": "public",
                        "database_name": "local",
                        "commit_lsn": 46346904
                    },
                    "action": "insert",
                    "changes": null
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```

        7. You'll also see the message appear on the messages tab for the webhook sink in the Sequin console.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced: Custom payloads and backfills

You now have a basic webhook subscription system that can capture and deliver every change to your users. But there are some additional features you can add to make the system more robust and flexible.

### Custom payloads

Using [transforms](/reference/transforms) you can define the exact data payload delivered to your users. For example, you probably don't need to deliver all the metadata about the notification, just the notification data itself.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Navigate to the transforms page">
        In the Sequin console, navigate to the "Transforms" page and click to create a new transform.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Define your transform">
        Give your transform a name, select **Transform function** as the type, and enter a description if you'd like.

        Now define the transform function. In this case, to just deliver the `message` field, you can use the following function:

        ```elixir
        def transform(action, record, changes, metadata) do
            %{
                message: record["message"],
            }
        end
        ```

        Click **Create transform** to save your transform.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the transform to your webhook sink">
        On the webhook sink configuration page, click the **Edit** button and in the **Transform** section select the transform you just created.

        In the future, you can update your `server.js` code to add this transform to the webhook sink automatically by adding the `transform` key to the body of your create sink request:

        ```js
        {
        name: sinkName,
        status: "active",
        database: "local",
        transform: "webhook_transform",
        table: "notifications",
        filters: [ ... ],
        destination: {
          type: "webhook",
          http_endpoint: endpointName,
          http_endpoint_path: "",
        },
        actions: ["insert", "update", "delete"],
      }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test your custom payload">
       Insert a new notification in your database:

       ```sql
       INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, message) VALUES (1, 'Is this just a message?');
       ```

       You should see the following output in your test webhook URL:

       ```json
       {
        "data": [
            {
            "message": "Is this just a message?"
            }
        ]
       }
       ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Backfills

Backfills are a powerful feature that allows you to replay data for a user on demand. This is useful in several scenarios:

- When first initializing a webhook subscription, to send historical data to the user
- If a user temporarily loses connectivity and misses some webhook events
- When developers need to re-sync or debug webhook data delivery

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create a `/backfill` endpoint">
        In your `server.js` file, add a new `/backfill` endpoint that makes a POST request to the Sequin Management API to start a backfill:

        ```js server.js
        // Endpoint to start a backfill for a webhook sink
        app.post("/backfill", async (req, res) => {
            const { sinkName } = req.body;
            if (!sinkName) {
                return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing sinkName parameter" });
            }

            try {
                // Make a POST request to the Sequin Management API to start a backfill
                const backfillResp = await axios.post(
                    `${SEQUIN_API_BASE}/sinks/${sinkName}/backfills`,
                    {},
                    {
                        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${SEQUIN_API_TOKEN}` },
                    }
                );

                res.json({
                    message: "Backfill started successfully",
                    backfillId: backfillResp.data.id,
                    state: backfillResp.data.state,
                });
            } catch (err) {
                console.error(
                    "Error starting backfill:",
                    err.response?.data || err.message
                );
                return res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to start backfill" });
            }
        });
        ```

        This endpoint takes in the name of the webhook sink you want to backfill and makes a POST request to the Sequin Management API to start a backfill.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test your backfill">
        Make a POST request to the `/backfill` endpoint to start a backfill:

        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/backfill -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sinkName": "user-1-notifications"}'
        ```

        You should see all the messages in the `notifications` table appear in your test webhook URL.
    </Step>
</Steps>

The Management API also provides a way to [monitor the status of a backfill](/management-api/backfills/get) so you can show users the status of their backfill and notify them when it's complete.

## Monitoring and alerting

With your webhook subscription system in place, you can monitor the health of the system using Prometheus and Grafana.

Sequin comes with a pre-configured Grafana instance that you can access at http://localhost:3000. If you log in with the default credentials, you'll see a dashboard with a few graphs to help you monitor your webhook sinks and backfills:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxWidth: '600px'}} src="/images/reference/grafana-dashboard.png" alt="Sequin Grafana dashboard" />
</Frame>

You can also ingest these metrics directly from Sequin's [`/metrics` endpoint](/reference/metrics) (on port 8376) to monitor Sequin in your tooling.
