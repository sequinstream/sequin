[Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) are on-demand, serverless functions that run on Vercel's global, edge network. They are executed in a variety of runtimes including Node.js, Edge, GO, Python and Ruby.

Often, you want to trigger a Vercel Function when a database row changes. For example, you may want to trigger a function as a side-effect of a database change, or fan out work to multiple services.

In this guide, you will learn how to setup a Sequin webhook sink to trigger a Vercel Function when a database row changes.

## Prerequisites

You are about to create a simple Vercel Function that logs a message to the console. You'll trigger this function by setting up a webhook sink in Sequin that sends a HTTP POST request to the function's URL with the payload of the database row that changed.

You'll need the following:

- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
- Sequin [installed locally](/quickstart/webhooks) or a [Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com/register)
- A [database](/connect-postgres) connected to Sequin

## Create a Vercel Function

Start by creating a new Vercel Function that takes in a Sequin webhook sink [payload](/reference/sinks/webhooks#request-format) and logs the payload to the console.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Create a new Next.js project">
Create a new Next.js project if you don't have one:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add function code">
Create a new API route at `app/api/hello/route.ts` with the following code:

```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
  if (!authHeader || authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET}`) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
  }

  try {
    const payload = await request.json();
    const { record } = payload;

    if (record && record.name) {
      console.log(`Hello ${record.name}`);
    } else {
      console.log('No name found in the payload.');
    }

    return new Response('Success', { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing request:', error);
    return new Response('Internal Server Error', { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

This function first checks the authorization header to make sure the request is coming from Sequin. Then it processes the [payload](/reference/sinks/webhooks#request-format) and logs the name from the payload to the console.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable">
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```bash
SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret-value
```

[Create a secret](/reference/sinks/webhooks#authentication) and set it as the `SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable. You will need to use this secret value in the Sequin dashboard when you create the webhook sink.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Vercel">
1. Install the Vercel CLI if you haven't already:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Deploy your app:
```bash
vercel
```

3. In the Vercel dashboard, add the `SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable with the same value you used locally.

Copy your deployment URL. You will need this URL when creating the webhook sink.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You've successfully created a Vercel Function that logs a message to the console when Sequin sends a HTTP POST request to the function's URL.
</Check>

## Use the CLI to tunnel to your local endpoint

Create a Sequin HTTP endpoint that points to your local Vercel Function:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Open HTTP Endpoint tab">
        In the Sequin web console, open the "HTTP Endpoint" tab and click the "Create HTTP Endpoint" button.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure endpoint">
        Enter a name for your endpoint (i.e. `local_endpoint`) and flip the "Use localhost" switch. Follow the instructions in the Sequin console to [install the Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview), then run:

        ```bash
        sequin tunnel --ports=3000:local-endpoint
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add authentication">
        Back in the Sequin web console, click "Add encryption header" and set the key to `Authorization` and the value to `Bearer SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` using the secret value you created above.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create endpoint">
        Click "Create HTTP Endpoint".
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a webhook sink

Create a webhook sink that captures changes to your database and sends a HTTP POST request to the local Sequin HTTP endpoint you created above:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Create a new sink">
        Navigate to the "Sinks" tab, click the "Create Sink" button, and select "Webhook Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select source table">
        Select the table you want to capture changes from (i.e `public.users`).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose message type">
        Specify whether you want to receive [changes](/reference/payloads) from the table.

        <Tip>
        If you're not sure which to choose, leave the default setting of "Changes". Changes are a better fit for event-driven use cases, like triggering workflows, which is usually what you want to do with webhooks.
        </Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Specify change types">
        If you selected changes, in "Records to process", you can indicate whether you want to receive `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` changes. Select all three for now. No need to add a filter.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure backfill">
        You can optionally indicate if you want your webhook endpoint to receive a [backfill](reference/backfills) of all or a portion of the table's existing data. For now, leave "Backfill" toggled off.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure message grouping">
        Under "Message grouping", leave the default option selected to ensure events for the same row are sent to your webhook endpoint in order.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure sink settings">
        Under "Webhook Sink configuration" leave the defaults:

        - Leave the default value of `30000 ms` for "Request timeout" as this is more than enough time for your function to process the request
        - Leave the default value of `1` for "Batch size" since you're just logging messages
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure HTTP endpoint">
        Under "HTTP Endpoint", enter the Sequin HTTP endpoint you created above. Then click to "Add Encrypted Header" with the key `Authorization` and the value `Bearer SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, using the secret value you set in your Lambda function's environment variables.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Name and create sink">
        Give your sink a name (i.e. `users_webhook_sink`) and click "Create Webhook Sink".
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
    Your Sequin consumer is now created and ready to send events to your function.
</Check>

## Test end-to-end
<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Spin up you dev environment">
    1. The Next.js app is running: `npm run dev`
    3. The Sequin tunnel is running: `sequin tunnel --ports=3000:local_endpoint`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a row to your database">

    ```sql
    insert into
    users (name)
    values
      (
        'John Doe'
      );
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trace the change in the Sequin dashboard">
    In the Sequin console, open the "Messages" tab on your webhook sink and confirm that a message was delivered:
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/guides/vercel/message-delivered.png" alt="Message Delivered" />
    </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Confirm the event was received by your endpoint">
    In your local terminal, you should see a `200` response in your Next.js app:

    ```bash
    POST /api/hello 200 in 242ms
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You've successfully triggerd a Vercel Function from a database change!
</Check>

## Deploy to Vercel
<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Deploy your Next.js app to Vercel">

        - "Key": `SEQUIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
        - "Value": your-secret-value (use the same value you set in your `.env.local` file)

    4. Click "Save" to add the environment variable.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a production consumer">
    In the Sequin console, create a new webhook sink that points to your Vercel Function's HTTP endpoint.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify your deployment">
    1. After setting the environment variable, trigger a database change (e.g., insert a new user) to ensure that Sequin can successfully send events to your deployed Vercel Function.
    2. Check the logs in the Vercel dashboard to confirm that your function is receiving the events and processing them correctly.
    </Step>
