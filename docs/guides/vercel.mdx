[Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) are on-demand, serverless functions that run on Vercel's global, edge network. They are executed in a variety of runtimes including Node.js, Edge, GO, Python and Ruby.

You are already using Vercel Functions if your using api routes in Next.js, or using the Vercel API. Often times, you trigger Vercel Functions from your application when a user takes an action - but Sequin allows you to trigger

## Prerequisites

## Create a Vercel Edge Function

## Create a Sequin Push Consumer

## Test the setup

## Next steps: deploy to Vercel
