Once you've created your Sequin sinks locally, you can move your implementation to production.

You can use the [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) to export your local configuration and apply it to your production environment.

For AWS deployments, see the [deployment directory](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/tree/main/deployment) in the repository which contains Terraform infrastructure-as-code templates for deploying Sequin on AWS ECS.

## Prerequisites

- The [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) installed locally, setup with contexts for both your local and production environments

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export your configuration">
    Export your local configuration:

    ```bash
    sequin config export --context=local
    ```

    Replace `local` with the name of your local or development context.

    This creates a `sequin.yaml` file you can commit to your repository.

    <Info>
      Consider having different YAML files for different environments. For example, `sequin.staging.yaml` and `sequin.production.yaml`.

      Database names often differ between environments (e.g. `my_db_dev` vs `my_db_prod`).
    </Info>

    <Warning>
      `sequin config export` is still early and experimental. See the warnings given when you run the command.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply to production">
    Apply your configuration to production:

    ```bash
    sequin config apply sequin.yaml --context=production
    ```

    Replace `production` with the name of your production context.

    Sequin will show you the changes it will apply to your production environment. If they look good, confirm by entering `yes`.
