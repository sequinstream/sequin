import CreateSequinDbUser from '/snippets/create-sequin-db-user.mdx';

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to connect your [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/) to Sequin.

## Provision a Postgres user for Sequin
<CreateSequinDbUser />

## Enable logical replication on Azure Database for PostgreSQL

By default, logical replication is not enabled on Azure Database for PostgreSQL. You can double check if logical replication is enabled by connecting to your database and running the following command:

```sql
SHOW rds.logical_replication;
```

If the output is `off`, then logical replication is not enabled.

To enable it, follow these steps:

<Warning>Enabling replication requires a restart of your database server.</Warning>

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Configure server parameters">
    In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and follow these steps:

    - Go to the "Server parameters" page
    - Set the following parameters:
      - `wal_level`: Set to `logical`
       - `shared_preload_libraries`: Add `pglogical` to the list (if not already present)
       - `azure.extensions`: Add `pglogical` to the list (if not already present)
      - `max_worker_processes`: Set to at least `16`
    - Click "Save" to apply the changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart the server">
    After changing the server parameters, you need to restart your server for the changes to take effect. In the Azure Portal:

    - Go to the "Overview" page of your PostgreSQL server
    - Click the "Restart" button at the top of the page
    - Confirm the restart when prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure network access">
    Ensure that your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server allows network traffic from your connecting resource. You may need to add firewall rules or configure virtual network settings in the Azure Portal.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect Sequin to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL

After enabling logical replication on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, you'll now connect to your database in Sequin.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enter connection details in Sequin">
    In the Sequin Console, click on the "Connect Database" button and enter the credentials for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL:

    <Note>
      You can find these connection details in your Azure Portal under the PostgreSQL server's "Connection strings" section.
    </Note>

    - Host: Your Azure PostgreSQL server hostname
    - Port: 5432 (default Postgres port)
    - Database: Your database name
    - Username: The sequin database user you created earlier
    - Password: The password for your sequin database user

    Make sure to enable the "SSL" option for secure connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a publication">
    Connect to your database using the SQL client of your choice and execute the following SQL query to create a publication:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR TABLE table1, table2, table3;
    ```

    If you want to publish changes from all tables, you can use:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a replication slot">
    Next, create a replication slot to capture changes from the publication:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the replication slot details in Sequin">
    Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`) you just created. Then, name your database and click "Create Database".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a sink

With your Azure Database connected to Sequin, you are ready to create a sink. Follow one of our guides below to get started:
