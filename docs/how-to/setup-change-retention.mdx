This guide shows you how to set up [change retention](/reference/change-retention) in Sequin to store change messages (inserts, updates, and deletes) in your database. Then, you can stream those changes to a Sequin [sink](/reference/sinks/overview).

By the end of this guide, you'll have a table that stores change messages in a Postgres table in your database. Then, you can stream those changes to a Sequin [sink](/reference/sinks/overview) and have the ability to [backfill changes](/reference/backfills) at any time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Sequin [installed and configured](/running-sequin) in your environment
- Permission to create tables in your database

## Steps

Open the Sequin web console and navigate to the **Change Retention** tab. Click "Create retention".

### Configure source

<Steps>

  <Step title="Select the source table">
    Select the table you want to capture changes from.
    </Step>

  <Step title="Configure filters">
    Optionally, specify which operations to capture (e.g., `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete`). You can also add [column filters](/reference/filters) to capture only certain changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure column selection (optional)">
    Optionally, select which columns to include or exclude from the synced changes. This allows you to exclude sensitive columns or irrelevant metadata columns, or include only the specific columns you need. You can choose to:
    - **Sync all columns** (default)
    - **Exclude specific columns**: All columns except the ones you select will be synced
    - **Include only specific columns**: Only the columns you select will be synced
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure destination

If you've created a change event table previously, you can select it from the list.

Otherwise, click **Create new change event table** to create a new table. This will open a modal that guides you through creating the table:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a retention policy">
    Choose a [retention policy](/reference/change-retention#retention-policy) for change messages.

    If you're not sure what to choose, we recommend selecting "None" and setting up a retention policy later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the DDL commands">
    Copy the DDL commands from the modal and run them in your database.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the retention">
    Give your change retention a name, and click **Create**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more details on the options available, see the [reference](/reference/change-retention).

## Verify

Test that changes are being captured correctly:

1. Connect to your database
2. Make a test change to your source table:

```sql
-- Example: Insert a new row
insert into your_table (column1, column2) 
values ('test1', 'test2');
```

3. Verify the change was captured into the destination table:

```sql
select action, record_pk, record, changes
from sequin_changes
order by id desc
limit 1;
```

## Next steps

Now that you've set up change retention, you can stream changes to a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview). With retention enabled, you can backfill changes to your sink at any time.
