This guide provides step-by-step instructions to connect your [Neon](https://neon.tech/) database to Sequin.

## Provision a Postgres user for Sequin
<CreateSequinDbUser />

## Enable logical replication on Neon

By default, logical replication is not enabled on Neon. To turn it on, follow these steps:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Navigate to your project's logical replication settings">
    Open your project in the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/). Then, navigate to the **Beta** section: "Project settings" > "Logical Replication".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable logical replication">
    Click on the **Enable** button to activate logical replication.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>

## Connect Sequin to your Neon database

After enabling logical replication on Neon, you'll now connect to your Neon database in Sequin.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enter connection details in Sequin">
    In the Sequin Console, click on the "Connect Database" button and enter the following details for your Neon database:

    <Note>
      You can find these connection details in your Neon project dashboard under the "Connection details" section:
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/guides/neon/neon-connection-details.png" alt="Neon connection details" />
      </Frame>
    </Note>

    - Host: Your Neon host (e.g., `ep-cool-snow-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`)
    - Port: 5432 (default Postgres port)
    - Database: Your database name
    - Username: The sequin database user you created earlier
    - Password: The password for your sequin database user

    Make sure to enable the "SSL" option for secure connection.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a publication">
    Connect to your database using the SQL client of your choice and execute the following SQL query to create a publication:

        ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR TABLE table1, table2, table3 WITH (publish_via_partition_root = true);
    ```

    If you want to publish changes from all tables, you can use:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION sequin_pub FOR ALL TABLES WITH (publish_via_partition_root = true);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a replication slot">
    Next, create a replication slot to capture changes from the publication:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the replication slot details in Sequin">
    Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`) you just created. Then, name your database and click **Create Database**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a sink

With your Neon database connected to Sequin, you are ready to create a sink. Follow one of our guides below to get started:
