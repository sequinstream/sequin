This guide provides step-by-step instructions to connect your [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) database to Sequin. TimescaleDB is an open-source database built on Postgres that's optimized for time-series data.

## Setting up TimescaleDB

If you don't have a TimescaleDB instance yet, you can set one up using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16
```

## Enable logical replication

To determine if logical replication is already enabled for your TimescaleDB instance, you can run the following SQL command:

```sql
show wal_level;
```

This command should return `logical`. If it doesn't, you'll need to enable it by setting `wal_level` to `logical`.

<Warning>Enabling replication requires a restart of your database.</Warning>

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Configure WAL level">
    Connect to your TimescaleDB container and edit the PostgreSQL configuration:

```bash
# Connect to the container
docker exec -it timescaledb bash

# Edit postgresql.conf
echo "wal_level = logical" >> /home/postgres/pgdata/data/postgresql.conf

# Exit the container
exit

# Restart the container for changes to take effect
docker restart timescaledb
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can also find the location of your `postgresql.conf` file by running the SQL command `show config_file;`.

## Connect Sequin to your TimescaleDB database

After enabling logical replication, you'll now connect to your database in Sequin:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enter connection details in Sequin">
    In the Sequin Console, click on the "Connect Database" button and enter the credentials for your TimescaleDB database:

    - Host: Your TimescaleDB host (e.g., `localhost` or your Docker machine IP)
    - Port: 5432 (default Postgres port)
    - Database: Your database name
    - Username: The sequin database user you created earlier
    - Password: The password for your sequin database user
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a publication">
    Connect to your database using the SQL client of your choice and execute the following SQL query to create a publication:

```sql
create publication sequin_pub for all tables;
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a replication slot">
    Next, create a replication slot to capture changes from the publication:

```sql
select pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the replication slot details in Sequin">
    Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`) you just created. Then, name your database and click "Create Database".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a sink

With your TimescaleDB database connected to Sequin, you are ready to create a sink. Follow one of our guides below to get started:
