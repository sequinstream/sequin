This guide shows you how to use Sequin to set up real-time streaming of database changes from Postgres to your webhook endpoints.

With Postgres data streaming to your application, you can trigger workflows, keep services in sync, [build audit logs](/how-to/create-audit-logs), [maintain caches](/how-to/maintain-caches), and more.

By the end of this how-to, you'll have a configured HTTP endpoint receiving database changes.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you:

1. [Already have Sequin installed](/quickstart/webhooks)
2. [Have a database connected](/quickstart/connect-postgres)

## Basic setup

### Prepare your HTTP endpoint

{/* TODO: Link out to examples */}

Sequin converts Postgres changes and rows into JSON and sends them to your HTTP endpoint.

You'll need to create an HTTP endpoint on your server that Sequin can send data to. You can always start by creating a simple request handler, and then update it to process payloads after you get things working end-to-end.

To see the shape of the webhook payloads that Sequin sends, see the [webhook sink reference](/reference/sinks/webhooks#payloads).

Your webhook endpoint must return a `200 OK` after successfully processing a batch of messages. Sequin will consider any other response code a failure, and will [mark the message for re-delivery](reference/sinks/webhooks#delivery-configuration).

<Tip>
  If you're using Sequin Cloud and developing locally, you can use the Sequin CLI's [`tunnel` command](/reference/cli/overview#tunnel) to connect Sequin's servers to a local HTTP endpoint. So, no need to deploy your application just yet!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  If you're not ready to add an HTTP endpoint to your application just yet, you can use a service like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to receive webhooks.
</Tip>

#### Authentication

Before deploying your HTTP endpoint to production, you should add authentication. This way, your application can verify that requests are coming from Sequin.

A simple strategy is to generate a secure token and require it in the `Authorization` header of inbound requests. You'll supply this token to Sequin by adding it as a header for your HTTP endpoint.

Here's how to generate a secure token with `openssl`:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### (Optional) Create a Change Capture Pipeline

You can send either [changes or rows](/reference/messages) to your webhook endpoint.

If you're sending changes, note that changes are ephemeral. Sequin stores `insert`, `update`, and `delete` changes in a buffer table until they're delivered to your webhook endpoint.

You can use a [Change Capture Pipeline](/reference/change-capture-pipelines) to persist changes to a table in your database. Then, you can stream _that_ table to your webhook endpoint. This gives you the power to [run backfills](/reference/backfills)/replays of recent changes at any times. This can be handy: for example, if you realize there's a bug in your webhook handling implementation, you can deploy the fix and re-process changes from the last few minutes or days.

### Create HTTP endpoint

Under "Resources", navigate to the "HTTP Endpoints" tab and click "Create HTTP Endpoint".

When setting up a webhook sink, you can specify the request path as well as additional headers. So:

1. For the "URL" field, fill in the base URL for your HTTP endpoint.
2. For the "Headers" field, include essential headers for your HTTP endpoint (e.g. `Content-Type: application/json`).

Sensitive headers like `Authorization` should be added under "Encrypted Headers".

## Create webhook sink

Navigate to the "Sinks" tab, click "Create Sink", and select "Webhook Sink".

### Configure the source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select source table">
    Under "Source", select the table you want to stream data from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose message type">
    Specify whether you want to receive [changes or rows](/reference/messages) from the table.

    If you're not sure which to choose, select **Changes**. Changes are a better fit for event-driven use cases, like triggering workflows, which is usually what you want to do with webhooks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify filters">
    If you selected changes, in "Records to process", you can indicate whether you want to receive `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` changes.

    You can also specify [SQL filters](/reference/filters) to narrow down the webhooks you want to receive. For example, if you only want to receive webhooks for `subscriptions` that currently have an `mrr` greater than $100, you can add a filter on `mrr > 100`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify backfill">
    You can optionally indicate if you want your webhook endpoint to receive a [backfill](reference/backfills) of all or a portion of the table's existing data. Backfills are useful if you want your webhook endpoint to process historical data. For example, if you're materializing a cache, you might want to warm it with existing rows.

    You can backfill at any time. If you don't want to backfill, toggle "Backfill" off.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify message grouping">
    Under "Message grouping", you'll most likely want to leave the default option selected to ensure events for the same row are sent to your webhook endpoint in order.

    If while your webhook endpoint is processing a message, a new change or version related to the same row is captured, [Sequin will hold the message back](reference/ordering-and-grouping) until your webhook endpoint acknowledges the first message. This is almost always the desired behavior.
  </Step>

</Steps>

### Configure delivery

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specify request timeout">
    Under "Delivery configuration", choose a conservative value for "Request timeout". The right value depends on how long you want to give your webhook endpoint to process a batch of messages. When the request timeout is reached, Sequin [will mark the message for re-delivery](reference/sinks/webhooks#delivery-configuration).

    If your programming platform allows it, we recommend wrapping the webhook request handler in your application with a hard timeout limit below the "Request timeout" specified here. That way, if your handler is taking too long, it will be killed before Sequin retries the message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify batch size">
    The right value for "Batch size" depends on your requirements.

    The simple rule is that you should try to match the batch size of messages to the unit of work your webhook handler will do.

    For example, for event-driven use cases like triggering side effects one-by-one, you'll probably want to set this to `1`. Otherwise, you risk your worker partially processing a batch then crashing. Then, when Sequin retries the batch, your handler will re-process the beginning of the batch.

    Conversely, for replication use cases, like batch upserting to a database, you'll want to set this to an optimal value for that batch upsert operation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify advanced delivery configuration">
    See the [webhook sink reference](/reference/sinks/webhooks#delivery-configuration) for more information on advanced delivery configuration options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the HTTP endpoint you created">
    Under "HTTP Endpoint", select the HTTP endpoint you created earlier.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the sink">
    Give your sink a name, then click "Create Webhook Sink".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify & debug

To verify that your webhook sink is working:

1. Make some changes in your source table.
2. Verify that the count of messages for your sink increases in the Sequin web console.
3. Verify receipt of messages in your webhook endpoint logs.

If messages don't seem to be flowing:

1. Click the "Messages" tab to view the state of messages for your sink.
2. Click any failed message.
3. Check the delivery logs for error details, including the response from your webhook endpoint.

## Next steps

Assuming you've followed the steps above for your local environment, "[How to deploy to production](/how-to/deploy-to-production)" will show you how to deploy your implementation to production.
