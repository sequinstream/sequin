This guide shows you how to set up Postgres change data capture (CDC) and stream changes to Google Cloud Pub/Sub using Sequin.

With Postgres data streaming to Pub/Sub, you can trigger workflows, keep services in sync, [build audit logs](/how-to/create-audit-logs), [maintain caches](/how-to/maintain-caches), and more.

By the end of this how-to, you'll have database changes flowing to a Pub/Sub topic.

## Prerequisites

If you're self-hosting Sequin, you'll need:

1. [Sequin installed](/running-sequin)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)
3. A Google Cloud project

If you're using Sequin Cloud, you'll need:

1. [A Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)
3. A Google Cloud project

## Basic setup

### Enable Pub/Sub

In the Google Cloud console, navigate to [Pub/Sub](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub) and ensure it's enabled for your project.

### Create a Pub/Sub topic

1. Navigate to the [Pub/Sub Topics page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/list) in your Google Cloud Console
2. Click "CREATE TOPIC"
3. Enter a topic ID (e.g., "postgres-changes")
4. (Optional) Enable "message retention" if you want to be able to replay messages
4. Click "CREATE"

Make note of your:
- Google Cloud project ID (e.g., "my-project-123")
- Pub/Sub topic ID (e.g., "postgres-changes")

### Create a service account

1. Navigate to the [IAM & Admin > Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page
2. Select a project (if one is not already selected)
3. Click "CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT"
4. Enter a name (e.g., "sequin-publisher")
4. Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE"
5. Add the following two roles:
   - "Pub/Sub Publisher" (`roles/pubsub.publisher`)
   - "Pub/Sub Viewer" (`roles/pubsub.viewer`)
6. Click "CONTINUE"
6. Click "DONE"
7. Click on the newly created service account
8. Go to the "KEYS" tab
9. Click "ADD KEY" > "Create new key"
10. Choose "JSON" format
11. Click "CREATE"

The JSON key file will be downloaded to your computer. Keep this safe - you'll need it when configuring the Pub/Sub sink in Sequin.

## Create Pub/Sub sink

In Sequin, navigate to the "Sinks" tab, click "Create Sink", and select "Pub/Sub Sink".

### Configure the source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select source table or schema">
    Under "Source", select the table or schema you want to stream data from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose message type">
    Specify whether you want to receive [changes or rows](/reference/messages) from the table.

    If you're not sure which to choose, you can leave the default option "Changes" selected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify filters">
    If you selected changes, in "Records to process", you can indicate whether you want to receive `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` changes.

    You can also specify [SQL filters](/reference/filters) to narrow down the events you want to receive. For example, if you only want to receive events for `subscriptions` that currently have an `mrr` greater than $100, you can add a filter on `mrr > 100`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify backfill">
    You can optionally indicate if you want Pub/Sub to receive a [backfill](reference/backfills) of all or a portion of the table's existing data. Backfills are useful if you want to use Pub/Sub to process historical data.

    You can backfill at any time. If you don't want to backfill, toggle "Backfill" off.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify message grouping">
    Under "Message grouping", you'll most likely want to leave the default option selected to ensure events for the same row are sent to Pub/Sub in order.

    That way, if you're using a Pub/Sub subscription with "message ordering" enabled, your system will receive events for a row in the [same order they occurred in Postgres](reference/sinks/gcp-pubsub#grouping-and-ordering).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure Pub/Sub

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Pub/Sub details">
    Fill in your Pub/Sub connection details:

    - **Project ID** (required): Your Google Cloud project ID (e.g., "my-project-123")
      - You can find this on the home page of the Google Cloud Console
    - **Topic ID** (required): The Pub/Sub topic ID (e.g., "postgres-changes")
    - **Service Account Credentials** (required): Paste the entire contents of your service account JSON key file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm connection">
    Click "Test Connection" to verify that Sequin can connect to your Pub/Sub topic.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the sink">
    Give your sink a name, then click "Create Pub/Sub Sink".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify & debug

To verify that your Pub/Sub sink is working:

1. Make some changes in your source table
2. Verify that the count of messages for your sink increases in the Sequin web console
3. In the Google Cloud Console:
   - Navigate to your Pub/Sub topic
   - Click on the "MESSAGES" tab
   - Under "Step 2", select a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription
   - Click "PULL" to see messages in the topic

If messages don't seem to be flowing:

1. Click the "Messages" tab to view the state of messages for your sink
2. Click any failed message
3. Check the delivery logs for error details, including any Pub/Sub API errors

Common issues to check:
- Service account credentials are valid and not expired
- Service account has the "Pub/Sub Publisher" role
- Project ID and Topic ID match exactly
- Topic exists in the specified project

## Next steps

- **Setup a processor**

   Now that your Postgres data is flowing into Pub/Sub, you can setup a subscriber to read from the topic and process the data. See the [Pub/Sub documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pull) for details on consuming messages.

   Refer to the [Pub/Sub sink reference](/reference/sinks/gcp-pubsub) for the shape of messages that Sequin will publish.

- **Deploy your implementation**

   When you're ready to deploy your implementation, see "[How to deploy to production](/how-to/deploy-to-production)".

- **Advanced configuration**
