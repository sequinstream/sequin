This guide shows you how to set up Postgres change data capture (CDC) and stream changes to NATS using Sequin.

With Postgres data streaming to NATS, you can trigger workflows, keep services in sync, [build audit logs](/how-to/create-audit-logs), [maintain caches](/how-to/maintain-caches), and more.

By the end of this how-to, you'll have database changes flowing to a NATS subject.

## Prerequisites

If you're self-hosting Sequin, you'll need:

1. [Sequin installed](/running-sequin)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)
3. A NATS server ready to go

If you're using Sequin Cloud, you'll need:

1. [A Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)
3. A NATS server ready to go

## Basic setup

### Prepare your NATS server

You'll need a NATS server ready for Sequin to stream changes to. You can use either a local server for development or a cloud-hosted NATS service in production.

#### Local development with Docker

For local development with Sequin, you can quickly spin up a NATS server using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name nats -p 4222:4222 -d nats:latest
```

## Create NATS sink

Navigate to the "Sinks" tab, click "Create Sink", and select "NATS Sink".

### Configure the source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select source table or schema">
    Under "Source", select the table or schema you want to stream data from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose message type">
    Specify whether you want to receive [changes](/reference/payloads) from the table.

    If you're not sure which to choose, you can start with the default, "Changes".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify filters">
    If you selected changes, in "Records to process", you can indicate whether you want to receive `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` changes.

    You can also specify [SQL filters](/reference/filters) to narrow down the events you want to receive. For example, if you only want to receive events for `subscriptions` that currently have an `mrr` greater than $100, you can add a filter on `mrr > 100`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify backfill">
    You can optionally indicate if you want NATS to receive a [backfill](reference/backfills) of all or a portion of the table's existing data. Backfills are useful if you want to use NATS to process historical data.

    You can backfill at any time. If you don't want to backfill, toggle "Backfill" off.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify message grouping">
    Under "Message grouping", you'll most likely want to leave the default option selected to ensure events for the same row are sent to NATS in order.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure NATS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter NATS connection details">
    Fill in your NATS connection details:

    - **Host** (required): The hostname of your NATS server (e.g., `localhost` or `nats.example.com`)
    - **Port** (required): The port number (default: 4222)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the sink">
    Give your sink a name, then click "Create NATS Sink".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify & debug

To verify that your NATS sink is working:

1. Using the NATS CLI, subscribe to your subjects:
   ```bash
   nats sub "sequin.>"
   ```
2. Make some changes in your source table
3. Verify that the count of messages for your sink increases in the Sequin web console
4. Verify that the messages appear in your NATS subscription

If messages don't seem to be flowing:

1. Click the "Messages" tab to view the state of messages for your sink
2. Click any failed message
3. Check the delivery logs for error details, including any NATS connection errors

Common issues to check:
- NATS server is running and accessible
- Host and port are correct
- Network connectivity between Sequin and NATS

## Next steps

- **Setup a processor**

   Now that your Postgres data is flowing into NATS, you can setup a subscriber to read from the subjects and process the data. See the [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/subjects) for details on consuming messages.

   Refer to the [NATS sink reference](/reference/sinks/nats) for the shape of messages that Sequin will publish.

- **Deploy your implementation**

   When you're ready to deploy your implementation, see "[How to deploy to production](/how-to/deploy-to-production)".

- **Advanced configuration**

   For more about how NATS sinks work, see the [NATS sink reference](/reference/sinks/nats).
