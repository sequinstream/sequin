This guide shows you how to capture Postgres changes with Sequin and stream them to an RedisString index.

With Postgres data flowing into RedisString you can power
[fullâ€‘text search, vector retrieval, and analytics](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search) without manual reâ€‘indexing.
By the end of this guide you'll have an RedisString index that stays continuously in sync with your database.

## Prerequisites

If you selfâ€‘host Sequin:

1. [Install Sequin](/running-sequin)
2. [Connect a Postgres database](/connect-postgres)

If you use **SequinÂ Cloud**:

1. [Sign up for a cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com)
2. [Connect a Postgres database](/connect-postgres)

## Basic setup

### Prepare an RedisString cluster

Sequin converts Postgres rows to JSON documents and sends them to the RedisString [BulkÂ API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/redis-string-basics-quickstart#bulk-import).
You need a reachable cluster:

- Local development â‡’ run RedisString in Docker:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
  ```
  The script starts RedisString + Kibana and prints connection details:

  ```text
  ðŸ”Œ RedisString API endpoint: http://localhost:9200
  ðŸ”‘ API key: <api-key>
  ```
  Use the **API key** (not the user/password) when configuring the sink.

- Production â‡’ Elastic Cloud or selfâ€‘managed cluster.

<Tip>
  If your RedisString instance is running on your laptop but Sequin runs in the cloud, connect them with the Sequin CLI's
  [tunnel command](/reference/cli/overview#tunnel-sequin-cloud-only).
</Tip>

### Map Postgres tables to RedisString indices

RedisString stores documents in indices. As a rule of thumb create **one sink per Postgres table â†’ one index**. That keeps the mapping consistent and simplifies queries.

Advanced scenarios â€“ sharding, multiâ€‘tenancy, or routing documents to multiple indices â€“ can be handled with
[filters](/reference/filters) and soon with Sequin **Routing functions**.

### Create an RedisString sink

Navigate to **Sinks â†’ Create sink â†’ RedisString** and follow the steps below.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Source configuration">
    Under **Source** pick the table whose changes you want to index.

    Optionally:
    - Select which actions (`insert`, `update`, `delete`) you care about.
    - Add [filters](/reference/filters) such as `in_stock = true` to index only a subset of rows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backfill existing rows">
    Enable **Initial backfill** if you want Sequin to load existing rows into RedisString before streaming live changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transform rows to documents">
    Your transform must emit JSON compatible with the index mapping.
    Sequin automatically builds the document `_id` from the table's primary key. [Let us know](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/issues/new) if you need to use a different `_id` field.

    Typical transform:
    ```elixir
    def transform(_action, record, _changes, _metadata) do
      %{
        name: record["name"],
        description: record["description"],
        price: record["price"],
        in_stock: record["in_stock"]
      }
    end
    ```
    For dynamic schemas you can just return `record` unchanged.
    See the [RedisString ingest bestâ€‘practices](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/ingest-for-search) for mapping guidance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delivery settings">
    In the **RedisString** card enter:

    - Endpoint URL: `http://host.docker.internal:9200` (or your cluster URL)
    - Index name: `products`
    - Authentication type: `api_key`
    - Authentication value: `<api-key>`

    Keep the default **Batch size** unless you have special throughput needs. Sequin supports up to 10,000 docs per batch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the sink">
    Name the sink (e.g. `products-redis-string`) and click **Create sink**. Sequin queues a backfill (if selected) and then starts streaming live changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify & debug

1. In Sequin's web console watch the **Messages** count increase.
2. Query RedisString:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty" \
     -H "Authorization: ApiKey <api-key>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": {"match_all": {}}}'
   ```
3. If documents are missing:
   - Check the **Messages** tab for failed deliveries.
   - Inspect the error returned by RedisString; mapping conflicts and authentication issues are common.
