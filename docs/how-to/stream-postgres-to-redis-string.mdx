This guide shows you how to capture Postgres changes with Sequin and stream them to Redis as key-value pairs using Redis Strings.

With Postgres data flowing into Redis, you can build high-performance caches that automatically stay in sync with your database. This approach eliminates stale cache entries and provides sub-millisecond access to your data.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you need:

1. A running Redis instance
2. Sequin installed and configured
3. A Postgres database connected to Sequin

If you haven't set these up yet:

- [Install Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)
- [Install Sequin](/running-sequin) or [sign up for Sequin Cloud](https://console.sequinstream.com)
- [Connect a Postgres database](/connect-postgres)

## Create a Redis String sink

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
    In the Sequin web console, go to **Sinks → Create sink → Redis String**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the source">
    Under **Source**:
    - Select the database and table or schema you want to cache
    - Choose which actions to capture (`insert`, `update`, `delete`). You likely want to cache all actions
    - Optionally add [filters](/reference/filters) to cache only specific rows
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up initial backfill">
    Toggle **Initial backfill** if you want to initialize your Redis cache with all of the current data in your Postgres table.

    You can choose to backfill again later via the Sequin web console or the [management API](/reference/management-api).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a transform">
    Create a transform to define how your Postgres data is stored in Redis. The most common transform is to store the entire record as a JSON object:

    ```elixir
    def transform(_action, record, _changes, _metadata) do
      record  # Store the entire record
    end
    ```

    For more selective caching, you can transform the data structure before storing it in Redis. For example, to cache only a few fields:

    ```elixir
    def transform(_action, record, _changes, _metadata) do
      %{
        "name" => record["name"],
        "price" => record["price"],
        "stock" => record["inventory_count"]
      }
    end
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Redis connection">
    Enter your Redis connection details:

    - **Host**: Your Redis server address (e.g., `localhost` or `redis.example.com`)
    - **Port**: Redis port (default: `6379`)
    - **Username/Password**: If authentication is enabled
    - **Database**: Redis database number (default: `0`)
    - **TLS**: Enable if your Redis server uses TLS
    - **Expire MS**: Optional expiration time in milliseconds for cached keys
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and create the sink">
    - Click **Test Connection** to verify Redis connectivity
    - Name your sink (e.g., `products-cache`)
    - Click **Create Sink**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding key formats

By default, Sequin uses this key format in Redis:

```
sequin:{table_name}:{primary_key}
```

For example, a product with ID 42 would be stored as:

```
sequin:products:42
```

For composite primary keys, values are joined with `-` (ie. `sequin:products:42-123`).

## Verify your cache is working

1. Check that data is flowing by watching the **Messages** tab in the Sequin console
2. Query Redis to see your cached data:

   ```bash
   redis-cli
   > KEYS sequin:products:*
   > GET sequin:products:1
   ```

3. Make a change in your Postgres database and verify it appears in Redis

## Common caching patterns

### Cache invalidation

Redis Strings sink automatically handles cache invalidation:
- Inserts and updates result in `SET` operations
- Deletes result in `DEL` operations

You don't need to implement your own cache invalidation logic.

### TTL-based caching

Set `expire_ms` to automatically expire keys after a specific period:

- `expire_ms: 86400000` => 24-hour cache
- `expire_ms: 3600000` => 1-hour cache

This is most useful to save only recently inserted or updated data in Redis, for instance if you want to reduce memory usage.

We otherwise recommend infinite TTL because Sequin automatically removes deleted records from Redis, as long as `delete` actions are enabled in the sink configuration.
