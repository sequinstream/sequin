This guide shows you how to set up Postgres change data capture (CDC) and stream changes to an **S2** stream using Sequin.

With Postgres data streaming to S2 you can trigger event-driven workflows, feed analytics pipelines, and fan-out events to other services.

By the end of this how-to, you'll have database changes flowing to an S2 stream.

## Prerequisites

If you're self-hosting Sequin, you'll need:

1. [Sequin installed](/running-sequin)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)

If you're using Sequin Cloud, you'll need:

1. [A Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)

And for S2 you'll need:

1. A [S2 Cloud account](https://s2.dev/sign-up)
2. The [S2 CLI](https://s2.dev/docs/quickstart#get-started-with-the-cli) installed (optional but recommended)

## Basic setup

### Create an S2 Access Token

In the [S2 web console](https://s2.dev/dashboard), open the **Access Tokens** page and click **+ Issue** to generate a new token.

Save this token in a secure location—you'll use it to configure both the S2 CLI and your Sequin S2 sink.

### Create a basin and stream

If you don't already have a basin and stream, create them via the S2 console or the CLI:

```bash
# Configure the CLI with your access token
s2 config set --access-token <your-access-token>

# Create a basin
s2 create-basin my-basin

# Create a stream called `products` inside that basin
s2 create-stream s2://my-basin/products
```

You can also perform these steps in the S2 console by navigating to **Basins → + Create Basin** and then **+ Create Stream**.

<Info>
  You can configure S2 Basins to automatically create streams when you create a new sink in Sequin by enabling the `Create stream on append` option in the S2 console or passing the `--create-stream-on-append` flag to the `s2 create-basin` command.
</Info>

<Check>
  Your S2 stream is now ready to receive data.
</Check>

## Create an S2 sink

Navigate to the **Sinks** tab in the Sequin console, click **Create Sink**, and choose **S2** as the sink type.

### Configure the source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select source schemas and tables">
    Under **Source**, pick the schemas and tables you want to stream data from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify filters">
    You can restrict to `insert`, `update`, and/or `delete` actions, and you can apply additional [filters](/reference/filters).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify backfill">
    Optionally send a [backfill](/reference/backfills) of existing rows. Disable **Backfill** if you only want new changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure S2

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter connection details">
    In the **S2** configuration card, enter:

    - **Basin** – the basin name you created earlier (e.g. `my-basin`)
    - **Stream** – the stream name (e.g. `products`)
    - **Access Token** – the S2 access token you generated
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the sink">
    Give your sink a name and click **Create Sink**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify & debug

To verify that your S2 sink is working:

1. Make a change in your source table.
2. Confirm that the **Messages** count for your sink increases in the Sequin console, and observe the new message in the **Messages** tab.
3. Use the S2 CLI to read from the stream and confirm events arrive:

   ```bash
   s2 tail -f s2://my-basin/products
   ```

If messages don't seem to be flowing:

1. Open the sink's **Messages** tab to inspect in-flight, failed, and delivered messages.
2. Click a failed message to see delivery logs and error details returned by S2.

## Next steps

- **Process the events**

  Build a consumer that reads from your S2 stream and processes the data.

- **Deploy your implementation**

  When you're ready, follow "[How to deploy to production](/how-to/deploy-to-production)".

- **Advanced configuration**

  Learn about batching, ordering guarantees, and other options in the [S2 sink reference](/reference/sinks/s2).

- **Start from scratch**
