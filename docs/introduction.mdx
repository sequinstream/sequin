Sequin is a tool for capturing changes and streaming data out of your Postgres database.

To stream data, you'll create [sequences](/how-sequin-works#sequences) for each table you want to stream. Then, you'll consume rows from the sequence using Sequin's [Consume API](/how-sequin-works#consume-api), [webhooks](/how-sequin-works#webhooks), or the [Sync API](/how-sequin-works#sync-api).

Sequin is great for:

1. **Replicating data** from your existing tables to other apps, databases, caches, materialized views, or frontend clients.
2. **Building event processing workflows** such as triggering side effects when data in Postgres changes.

Sequin guarantees exactly-once processing. That means you can use it to:

* Replace `listen`/`notify` with something more reliable.
* Fan-out data to other services.
* Replace Postgres triggers with functions in your app.
* Guarantee functions in your code are called given certain changes in Postgres.
* Streamline workflows by converting them to an event-driven model.
* Provide webhooks or sync endpoints to your customers.
* Replace Debezium/Kafka pipelines.
* Use Postgres instead of Kafka for streaming use cases.

Sequin is a Docker image you can run next to your Postgres database. Sequin itself is built on Postgres and uses Postgres to store consumer state.

## Killer features

- **Never miss a row or change:** Sequin ensures all database changes are delivered and processed exactly once by consumers.
- **SQL-based routing:** Filter and route messages to consumers using SQL `where` conditions.
- **Replays:** Rewind consumers to any row on your table. Or republish select messages that match a SQL query.
- **Start anywhere:** Consumers can start processing rows from any point in a table.
- **Bring your database:** Sequin is not an extension. It works with any Postgres database version 12\+.
- **No PL/pgSQL:** Define business logic in the language of your choice and in your application.
- **Transforms** (coming soon!): Transform message payloads by writing functions in Lua, JavaScript, or Go.

## Why Sequin?

We all know Postgres is great for storing and querying data. But what about when you need to stream data?

**Postgres has limited support for streaming.** Postgres is not a log, so tracking changes is difficult. Logical replication slots are ephemeral, and don't support all the features developers need. And Postgres doesn't have the concept of consumer groups or delivery tracking.

So, **Sequin adds streaming features to Postgres.** And importantly, Sequin keeps your data in Postgres. You can use your existing database in a new way without copying the data to a new system or mastering a new technology.

With Sequin, you can:

1. Stream a Postgres table in real-time and with exactly-once processing over an [HTTP interface](/how-sequin-works#consume-api).
2. Receive [webhooks](/how-sequin-works#webhooks) whenever rows change, with retries and backoff.
3. [Capture changes](/how-sequin-works#wal-pipelines) to Postgres tables as a series of events.
