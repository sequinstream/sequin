title: What is Sequin?
description: Sequin streams data out of your Postgres database. You can use Sequin to replicate data from your existing tables to other apps, databases, caches, materialized views, or frontend clients. Or you can use Sequin to build event processing workflows, such as triggering side effects when data in Postgres changes.

Sequin supports both [pull-based](/core-concepts#pull-consumers) and [push-based](/core-concepts#push-consumers) consumers over a simple HTTP interface with the following features:

- **Never miss a message:** Sequin delivers messages from your database to consumers until they are acknowledged (i.e. exactly-once processing guarantees).
- **SQL-based routing:** Filter and route messages to consumers using SQL `where` conditions.
- **Replays:** Rewind consumers to any row on your table. Or republish select messages that match a SQL query.
- **Start anywhere:** Consumers can start processing records from any point in a table.
- **Bring your database:** Sequin is not an extension. It works with any Postgres database version 12+.
- **No PL/pgSQL:** Define business logic in the language of your choice and in your application.
- **Transforms** (coming soon!): Transform message payloads by writing functions in Lua, JavaScript, or Go.

## How Sequin works

Sequin keeps your data in your Postgres database. You can use your existing database in a new way without copying the data to a new system or mastering a new technology.

Sequin connects to your Postgres database. It makes it easy to stream rows from tables and deliver them to downstream consumers with exactly-once processing guarantees. Consumers can read data over an HTTP interface similar to SQS, or Sequin can push changes to you via webhooks. Consumers can start wherever in the table they want, meaning you can turn historical data in Postgres into a stream of messages.

Sequin is open source. You can run Sequin in its own Docker container or as a sidecar container in your existing deployment.

Sequin comes with a web console/UI for configuration:

1. Connect any Postgres database to Sequin (Sequin uses primarily logical replication to detect changes).
2. Select the tables, actions, and SQL filters that publish messages to your consumers.
3. Consume messages using HTTP pull and push interfaces.
