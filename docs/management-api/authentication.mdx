All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token. The token can be found in the Sequin Console under the "Manage account" section.

## Retrieve your API token

You can retrieve your API token from the Sequin Console:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to account settings">
    Click your account name (next to the gear ⚙️ icon) in the bottom left corner and select "Manage account".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find your API token">
    Your API token is displayed under **API tokens**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can generate and delete API tokens as needed.

## Using your API token

Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

An example cURL request with Bearer token authorization:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sequinstream.com/api/sinks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Token security

- Keep your API tokens secure and never share them publicly
- Rotate your tokens regularly
- Delete tokens that are no longer needed
- Use different tokens for different environments (development, staging, production)
