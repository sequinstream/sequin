You can [retrieve your API token](/management-api/introduction ) in the [Sequin Console](https://console.sequinstream.com).

You'll include your token in the header of your HTTP requests. For example, with a client such as `curl`, you can include your token by using the `--header` option:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url api.sequinstream.com/api/http_pull_consumers/consumer_name/receive \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```
