You can [retrieve and manage your API tokens](/management-api/introduction ) in your account settings page in the [Sequin Console](https://console.sequinstream.com).

## API requests

You'll include your token in the header of your HTTP requests. For example, with a client such as `curl`, you can include your token by using the `--header` option:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url api.sequinstream.com/api/http_pull_consumers/{{sequin_stream_name}}/receive \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

## CLI

You can set your API token as a context variable in the [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) by running:

```bash
sequin context add {{CONTEXT_NAME}} --api-token={{YOUR_API_TOKEN}}
```
