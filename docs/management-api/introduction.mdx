The Sequin Management API allows you to programmatically control Sequin resources like sinks, HTTP endpoints, and backfills.

The API is intended for developers who want to manage Sequin resources from their own applications. This is useful for:
* Setting up sinks and backfills for your customers
* Automatically backfilling a sink, for instance to re-populate a cache destination

## Resources

The Management API provides endpoints for managing the following resources:

- [Sinks](/reference/sinks/overview) - Stream data from a table to a destination
- HTTP Endpoints for [webhook sinks](/reference/sinks/webhooks) - Configure webhook destinations
- [Backfills](/reference/backfills) - Backfill data from Postgres tables to a sink

Not all resources are available in the management API. If you need a resource that is not yet available, please [let us know](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/issues/932).


## Base URL

In cloud, the base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://api.sequinstream.com/api
```

In our dev docker compose setup, the base URL is:

```
http://localhost:7376/api
```

In self hosted deploys, you can access the API on the same port as the console. The URL will be something like:

```
http(s)://your-host:your-port/api
```

For the rest of this documentation, we provide paths to be concatenated onto the base URL. For instance, the path to list sinks is:

```
GET /sinks
```

And the fully qualified URL is:

```
https://api.sequinstream.com/api/sinks
```

or

```
http://localhost:7376/api/sinks
```


## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token. The token can be found in the Sequin Console under the "Manage account" section.

Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

An example cURL request with Bearer token authorization:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sequinstream.com/api/sinks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. See the [errors documentation](/management-api/errors) for details on error responses and handling.
