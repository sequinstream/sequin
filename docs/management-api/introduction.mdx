You'll use Sequin's API via the [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) to manage your Sequin resources and with the [Sequin Stream API](/reference/sequin-stream-api) to process messages in Sequin Stream sinks.

<Note>
  We're working on providing direct CRUD operations for Sequin resources via the API as well.
