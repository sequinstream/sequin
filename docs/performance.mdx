Sequin delivers industry-leading performance for change data capture (CDC), consistently achieving sub-200ms latency at 2,000 sustained operations per second. Here's how Sequin compares to other solutions:

| Tool | Latency at 2k ops/s |
|------|-------------------|
| **Sequin** | **192ms** |
| Debezium | 234ms |
| PeerDB | 30 seconds |
| Fivetran | 5 minutes |
| Airbyte | 1+ hours |

## Test Setup

Our benchmarks are conducted in a production-like environment. Sequin and Debezium are compared head-to-head capturing changes from [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) and delivering to [AWS MSK Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/):

- AWS RDS Postgres `db.r6g.xlarge` instance (4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)
- AWS MSK Kafka provisioned with 3 brokers
- Sequin running via ECS on an `m8g.xlarge` instance (4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)
- Debezium deployed on MSK Connect with 8 [MCUs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-connect-capacity.html).
- Continuous load of 2,000 operations per second applied to a single Postgres table
- 30-minute test duration
- Latency determined end-to-end from the time a change occurs in Postgres until it's available in AWS MSK Kafka

## Methodology

We measure end-to-end latency from the time a change occurs in Postgres until it's available in Kafka. This includes:

1. WAL read time
2. Processing time (filters, transformations, etc.)
3. Network transit time
4. Destination write time

The test is conducted with dedicated instances that apply load to the RDS instance and read from AWS MSK Kafka.

The load generation script applies a mixed workload of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations to the `benchmark_records` table at a total throughput of >= 2,000 operations per second.

The Posgres schema includes a single table with this schema:
```
                                           Table "public.benchmark_records"
     Column      |            Type             | Collation | Nullable |                    Default
-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------------------------------------
 id              | integer                     |           | not null | nextval('benchmark_records_id_seq'::regclass)
 string_field    | text                        |           |          |
 numeric_field   | numeric                     |           |          |
 timestamp_field | timestamp with time zone    |           |          |
 json_field      | jsonb                       |           |          |
 inserted_at     | timestamp without time zone |           |          | now()
 updated_at      | timestamp without time zone |           |          | now()
```

Records delivered to Kafka are annotated with a `delivered_at` timestamp. Full end-to-end latency is calculated by subtracting the `delivered_at` timestamp from the `updated_at` timestamp.

### Throughput Stability

Sequin maintains consistent performance even under sustained load: 

```bash
Average throughput: 2,054.4 ops/sec
Average latency: 192ms
99th percentile latency: 245ms
```

By comparison, Debezium achieves a slightly higher latency of 234ms at similar throughput:

```bash
Average throughput: 2000.6 ops/sec
Average latency: 234ms
99th percentile latency: 286ms
```

### Resource Utilization

The Sequin ECS task makes efficient use of provisioned resources, employing parallelism with lightweight processes. During the test, the Sequin ECS task averaged 34% CPU utilization and 10% memory utilization.
