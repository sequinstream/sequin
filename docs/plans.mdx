## Free | Self-Hosted

You can self-host Sequin on your own infrastructure for free. You'll be responsible for your own infrastructure and tuning Sequin to your needs. We're more than happy to help you get started and answer questions in our Discord or Slack communities.

<Tip>
If you need to run Sequin in your cloud, but want to guarantee high availability with dedicated support and SLAs then consider [Sequin Managed](#sequin-managed).
</Tip>

You can [start running Sequin in minutes](/running-sequin) and then [deploy to production](/how-to/deploy-to-production) when you're ready.

## Pay-as-you-go | Cloud

Sequin Cloud is our hosted offering. It's priced to be the most economical option when considering total cost of ownership.

You'll pay based on the amount of data you process through Sequin: (`# of messages` x `size of each message in bytes`):

| Gigabytes    | Price / GB |
|--------------|------------|
| 0 → 10      | $15        |
| 10 → 50     | $8         |
| 50 → 250    | $5         |
| 250 → 500   | $2.5       |
| 500 → 1,000 | $1         |
| 1K ++        | [Talk to us](mailto:founders@sequinstream.com) |

You don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure. We'll handle that for you.

As an example, if you send 100 million messages of 100 bytes each, Sequin will handle 10GB of data and you'll pay $150.

## Custom | Sequin Managed

With [Sequin Managed](/sequin-managed/overview), we'll deploy and manage Sequin in your cloud for you. We'll also provide dedicated support and SLAs.
