This guide serves as an overview of how to use Sequin to create real-time Postgres change data capture (CDC) pipelines.

By the end, you'll have a complete change data capture pipeline that streams database changes to a message queue or stream in real-time.

<Tip>
  We have more detailed guides for each sink destination under <b>Sink setup guides</b> in the sidenav.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

If you're self-hosting Sequin, you'll need:

1. [Sequin installed](/running-sequin)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)
3. A sink destination (like SQS, Kafka, Redis, or HTTP)

If you're using Sequin Cloud, you'll need:

1. [A Sequin Cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com)
2. [A database connected](/connect-postgres)
3. A sink destination (like SQS, Kafka, Redis, or HTTP)

## CDC architecture overview

Your change data capture pipeline will have three components:

1. **Source tables**: The tables or schemas in Postgres that you want to capture changes from.
2. **Filters and transformations**: Optional filters and transformations to apply to changes before they're delivered to your sink.
3. **Destination sink**: The message queue, stream, or webhook endpoint that Sequin delivers changes to (e.g. SQS, Kafka, or HTTP endpoint)

## Create a sink

With your Postgres [database connected](/connect-postgres) to Sequin, create a sink. Navigate to the **Sinks** tab and click the **Create Sink** button. Select the sink destination you want to use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the source">
    Select to include all tables and schemas in the publication, or select specific tables and schemas to either include or exclude.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add filters (optional)">
    Add [filters](/reference/filters) to the sink to control which database changes are sent to your sink.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add transform (optional)">
    Add a [transform](/reference/transforms) to the sink to modify the payload before it's sent to your sink.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify backfill">
    To stream existing rows in your source table, specify a [backfill](/reference/backfills).

    You can backfill all the data in your source table(s) or specify a custom subset of the table(s) using a SQL filter.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set message grouping">
    Messages in the same group are delivered in order. By default, Sequin will [group messages by primary key](/reference/sinks/overview#grouping-and-ordering).

    You can configure a different grouping strategy by selecting custom columns from the source table.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure sink-specific settings">
    Configure sink-specific settings:

    * [AWS Kinesis](/reference/sinks/kinesis) sinks: Specify your AWS Kinesis credentials and stream to deliver messages to.
    * [AWS SNS](/reference/sinks/sns) sinks: Specify your AWS SNS credentials and topic to deliver messages to.
    * [AWS SQS](/reference/sinks/sqs) sinks: Specify your SQS queue to deliver messages to.
    * [Azure EventHubs](/reference/sinks/azure-event-hubs) sinks: Specify your Azure EventHubs credentials and topic to deliver messages to.
    * [Elasticsearch](/reference/sinks/elasticsearch) sinks: Specify your Elasticsearch credentials and index to deliver messages to.
    * [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](/reference/sinks/gcp-pubsub) sinks: Specify your GCP Pub/Sub credentials and the topic to deliver messages to.
    * [Kafka](/reference/sinks/kafka) sinks: Specify your Kafka credentials and topic to deliver messages to.
    * [Meilisearch](/reference/sinks/meilisearch) sinks: Specify your Meilisearch credentials and index to deliver messages to.
    * [NATS](/reference/sinks/nats) sinks: Specify your NATS credentials and subject to deliver messages to.
    * [RabbitMQ](/reference/sinks/rabbitmq) sinks: Specify your RabbitMQ credentials and queue to deliver messages to.
    * [Redis Stream](/reference/sinks/redis-stream) sinks: Specify your Redis credentials and key to deliver messages to.
    * [Redis String](/reference/sinks/redis-string) sinks: Specify your Redis credentials and key to deliver messages to.
    * [S2](/reference/sinks/s2) sinks: Specify the S2 stream to deliver messages to.
    * [Sequin Stream](/reference/sinks/sequin-stream) sinks: Specify your Sequin Stream to deliver messages to.
    * [Typesense](/reference/sinks/typesense) sinks: Specify your Typesense credentials and collection to deliver messages to.
    * [Webhook](/reference/sinks/webhooks) sinks: Specify the HTTP endpoint to deliver messages to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the sink">
    Click **Create Sink** to create the sink and start streaming changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify your CDC pipeline is working

If you specified a backfill, there should be messages in your stream ready for your system to process. To observe these messages, navigate to the sink overview page and click the "Messages" tab. You should see messages flowing to your sink.

If you didn't specify a backfill, then create a change in your database (e.g. an insert, update, or delete) and verify that a message is delivered on the "Messages" tab.

## Next steps

You now have a complete change data capture pipeline that streams Postgres changes to a message queue or stream in real-time.

If you are using Sequin Cloud, you are ready to scale. If you are self-hosting Sequin, see "[Deploy to production](/how-to/deploy-to-production)" for guidance on copying your local sink configuration to your production environment.
