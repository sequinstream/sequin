<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Create a Sequin account">
    If you haven't already, create a [Sequin cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com/register) and login.

    <Note>If you're looking to run Sequin locally or self-host Sequin, start with our [other Quickstart guide](/quickstart/setup).</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your database">
    In the Sequin console, click on the **Connect Database** button. Enter the connection details for your Postgres database (i.e. host, port, database name, username, and password).

    </Frame>

    With your database credentials entered, set up replication. This allows Sequin to efficiently capture changes from your database using the WAL (Write-Ahead Log).

    In the Sequin console, enter the name for the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`). Then follow the instructions to copy and execute the SQL command to create the replication slot in your database:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/create-replication.png" alt="Create Replication Slot" />
    </Frame>

    Now, name your database and click **Create Database**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/successful-database-connection.png" alt="Database connected page" />
    </Frame>

    <Check>
    Your database is now connected to Sequin!
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Stream">
    Now, create a [Stream](/how-sequin-works#streams) to enable your database to stream changes.

    Navigate to the **Streams** tab and click the **Create Stream** button.

    Select the table you want to stream. Then, select the column Sequin should use to order changes, like an `updated_at` column or an incrementing `id` column:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/create-sequence.png" alt="Create Stream" />
    </Frame>

    Click **Create Stream**.

     <Check>
    You've created a Stream and your table is setup to stream.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consume rows">
    Sequin is setup to stream rows from your table. Now, consume rows from your Stream using the Consumer Group API, the Sync API, or Webhooks Subscriptions.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Consume Group API">
        Navigate to the **Consumer Groups** tab and click the **Create Consumer Group** button.

        Select the Stream you want to consume changes from. Then add any filters to narrow down the changes you want to capture:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/set-filters.png" alt="Select filters" />
        </Frame>

        Here, we've selected the `public.orders` Stream and applied a filter to only capture orders where the `total_amount` is greater than `100`. We're also configuring the consumer to process all the rows in the table.

        Now, enter the final details for your consume endpoint:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/create-consume-endpoint.png" alt="Set endpoint" />
        </Frame>

        You can accept the default timeout, max ack pending, and max waiting for now (you can change these at any time).

        Finally, give your endpoint a name and click **Create Consumer**:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/consume-api-created.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        To try out your consume endpoint, insert a new row on your table, then make a [`receive` request](/consume/consume-api/receive) to your endpoint:

        <div className="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{padding: '56.25% 0 0 0', position: 'relative'}}>
          <div className="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style={{height: '100%', left: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, width: '100%'}}>
            <iframe
              src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/1caxnzmfuo?seo=false&videoFoam=true"
              title="consume Video"
              allow="autoplay; fullscreen"
              allowTransparency={true}
              frameBorder="0"
              scrolling="no"
              className="wistia_embed"
              name="wistia_embed"
              msallowfullscreen
              style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
            ></iframe>
          </div>
        </div>
        <script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>


        You can see every row processed through your endpoint in the **Messages** tab.

        <Check>
          You can now consume rows from your table!
        </Check>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Webhook Subscriptions">
        Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click the **Create Subscription** button.

        Select the Stream you want to consume changes from. Then add any filters to narrow down the changes you want to capture:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/set-filters.png" alt="Select filters" />
        </Frame>

        Here, we've selected the `public.orders` Stream and applied a filter to only capture orders where the `total_amount` is greater than `100`. We're also configuring the consumer to process all the rows in the table.

        Now, enter the final details for your Webhook Subscription:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/create-webhook.png" alt="Set endpoint" />
        </Frame>

        - You can accept the default timeout and max ack pending for now (you can change these at any time).
        - Under "HTTP Endpoint", click the **Create and use a new Webhook.site endpoint**. This will generate a new HTTP endpoint on [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) that you can use for test purposes:

        <Note>You can setup custom endpoints, paths, and headers by clicking the **New HTTP Endpoint** button.</Note>

        Finally, give your Webhook Subscription a name and click **Create Consumer**:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/consumer-created.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        To test your Webhook Subscription, insert a new row on your table. You'll see a new message arrive at your endpoint:

        <div className="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{padding: '56.25% 0 0 0', position: 'relative'}}>
          <div className="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style={{height: '100%', left: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, width: '100%'}}>
            <iframe
              src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/89t8m6x7xe?seo=false&videoFoam=true"
              title="webhooks Video"
              allow="autoplay; fullscreen"
              allowTransparency={true}
              frameBorder="0"
              scrolling="no"
              className="wistia_embed"
              name="wistia_embed"
              msallowfullscreen
              style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
            ></iframe>
          </div>
        </div>
        <script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

        You can see every row processed by your Webhook Subscription in the **Messages** tab.

        <Check>
        Sequin is now sending rows from your table to your endpoint.
        </Check>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Sync API">
