Sequin streams the latest versions of rows from your tables. But sometimes you want to capture every discrete change to your tables, not just the latest state of each row. With [**WAL Pipelines**](/capture-changes/wal-pipelines), Sequin can capture inserts, updates, and deletes as they happen, storing them in an event log table in your database. You can then stream these events to your applications using Sequin's existing consumption methods.

<Info>
This quickstart assumes you've already [installed and setup Sequin](/quickstart/setup) in the prior quickstart. It refers to the `public.regions` table from that guide.

  <Step title="Create a WAL Pipeline" icon="list">
    Create a WAL Pipeline to capture changes:

    1. Navigate to the **WAL Pipelines** tab and click the **Create WAL Pipeline** button.

    2. Under "Source configuration", the `public.regions` table should be selected already:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/wal-pipeline-source-config.png" alt="Select WAL Pipeline source" />
        </Frame>

    3. Select which operations you want to capture. For this example, you can leave all three selected: `insert`, `update`, and `delete`:

        <Frame>
          <img style={{maxWidth: "400px"}} src="/images/quickstart/wal-pipeline-operations.png" alt="Select which Postgres operations to capture" />
        </Frame>

    5. You can skip "Add filter."

    4. Under "Destination configuration", click "Create event table." Here, Sequin shows you the steps for creating a table for your events:

        <Frame>
          <img style={{maxWidth: "500px"}}  src="/images/quickstart/wal-pipeline-create-event-table.png" alt="Create event table" />
        </Frame>

    5. Name the table `sequin_events`. Don't specify a retention policy. Then, to create the table, open a console to the `sequin_playground` database:

        ```bash
        psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:7377/sequin_playground?sslmode=disable'
        ```

    6. You can type `\e` and press `Enter` to open up the SQL editor. Then, paste in the SQL operations that Sequin provided to create the event table. (If your editor is Vim, type `:wq` to quit and run the commands.)

    7. After creating your event table, click "Done" to close the modal. Your new table should now appear in the destination list. Select it:

        <Frame>
          <img style={{maxWidth: "500px"}} 
          src="/images/quickstart/wal-pipeline-destination-config.png" alt="Select destination table" />
        </Frame>

    8. Give your WAL Pipeline a name (i.e. `region_to_sequin_events`) and click **Create WAL Pipeline**.

    Sequin will now capture every change to the `regions` table and write it to your event log.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make some changes" icon="play">
    Let's see the WAL Pipeline in action:

    1. Open a terminal and connect to the `sequin_playground` database:

        ```bash
        psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:7377/sequin_playground?sslmode=disable'
        ```

    2. Turn on "extended display" mode by typing `\x` and pressing `Enter`.

    3. Insert a new region:

        ```sql
        insert into public.regions (name, timezone) 
        values ('us-gov-west-1', 'pst');
        ```

    3. Query your event log table to see the insert:

        ```sql
        select action, record_pk, record, changes 
        from sequin_events 
        order by id desc 
        limit 1;
        ```

        You should see something like:

        ```json
        action    | insert
        record_pk | 9
        record    | {"id": 9, "name": "us-gov-west-1", "timezone": "pst", "updated_at": "2024-10-28T21:37:53", "inserted_at": "2024-10-28T21:37:53"}
        changes   |
        ```

    4. Update the region:

        ```sql
        update public.regions 
        set timezone = 'mst' 
        where name = 'us-gov-west-1';
        ```

    5. Query your event log again:

        ```sql
        select action, record_pk, record, changes 
        from sequin_events 
        order by id desc 
        limit 1;
        ```

        Now you'll see the update, including both the new values (`record`) and what changed (`changes`):

        ```json
        action    | update
        record_pk | 9
        record    | {"id": 9, "name": "us-gov-west-1", "timezone": "mst", "updated_at": "2024-10-28T21:39:21", "inserted_at": "2024-10-28T21:37:53"}
        changes   | {"timezone": "pst", "updated_at": "2024-10-28T21:37:53"}
        ```

    6. Finally, delete the region:

        ```sql
        delete from public.regions 
        where name = 'us-gov-west-1';
        ```

    7. Query your event log one more time to see the delete event:

        ```sql
        select action, record_pk, record, changes 
        from sequin_events 
        order by id desc 
        limit 1;
        ```

        The delete event includes the final state of the row before deletion:

        ```json
        action    | delete
        record_pk | 9
        record    | {"id": 9, "name": "us-gov-west-1", "timezone": "mst", "updated_at": "2024-10-28T21:39:21", "inserted_at": "2024-10-28T21:37:53"}
        changes   |
        ```

    <Check>
    You've captured insert, update, and delete events into your event log table!
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stream your events" icon="arrow-right">
    Now that you're capturing changes, you can create a Stream for your event log table and stream the events to consumers:

    1. Navigate to the **Streams** tab and click **Create Stream**.
    2. Select your `sequin_events` table.
    3. `seq` will be auto-selected as your sort column.
    4. Click **Create Stream**.

    You can now use the [Consume Group API](/quickstart/consume-with-api) or [webhooks](/quickstart/consume-with-webhooks) to stream these events to your applications.
