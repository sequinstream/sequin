With Sequin's **Webhook Subscriptions**, you can receive rows from your Streams as HTTP POST requests to your endpoints. Webhook Subscriptions offer exactly-once processing and automatic retries and backoffs if your endpoint is unavailable.

<Info>
This quickstart assumes you've already [installed and setup Sequin](/quickstart/setup) in the prior quickstart. It refers to the `public.regions` table from that guide.

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Create a Webhook Subscription" icon="webhook">
    After connecting a database and creating a Stream, you can consume rows from your Stream using a Webhook Subscription:

    1. Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click the **Create Subscription** button.

    2. The Stream you created for the `public.regions` table should already be selected:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/setup-consumer-source.png" alt="Select webhook source" />
        </Frame>

    3. Click "Add filter" and add a filter to only capture rows where the `timezone` is `pst`:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/set-consumer-filter.png" alt="Select filters" />
        </Frame>

    3. You can leave the consumer starting point at the default value of "At the beginning of the table." This will start the consumer at the first row in the Stream, playing the whole table from the beginning:


        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/set-consumer-start.png" alt="Set consumer start" style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }} />
        </Frame>

    4. Jump ahead to the **HTTP Endpoint** section (you can use the defaults for message grouping and configuration).

    5. Click the blue **Create and use a new Webhook.site endpoint** link:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/create-http-endpoint.png" alt="Create Webhook Subscription" />
        </Frame>

        This will generate a new HTTP endpoint on [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) that you can use for testing purposes.

    6. Finally, at the bottom of the form give your Webhook Subscription a name (i.e. `pst_regions`) and click **Create Webhook Subscription**.

        <Check>
          Sequin will now send rows that match your filter to your endpoint.
        </Check>

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/create-webhook-subscription.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

    7. Open the **Messages** tab to see the rows that have been sent:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/webhook-messages.png" alt="Messages" />
        </Frame>

    8. Click on one of the messages to see the delivery details including the logs for the message:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/message-logs.png" alt="Message logs" />
        </Frame>

    9. Go back to the **Overview** tab, and click the **View on Webhook.site** button to open the Webhook.site dashboard:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/webhook-dot-site.png" alt="Webhook.site" />
        </Frame>

        <Check>
        You'll see that Sequin processed every row in the table, sending each row to your endpoint!
        </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert and update rows" icon="play">
    To learn how Sequin works, perform some `insert` and `update` operations on the `public.regions` table:

    1. Open a terminal and connect to the `sequin_playground` database:

        ```bash
        psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:7377/sequin_playground?sslmode=disable'
        ```
    2. Create a new region in the `public.regions` table:

        ```bash
        INSERT INTO public.regions (name, timezone) VALUES ('us-gov-west-1', 'pst');
        ```

        This row matches the filter of your Webhook Subscription, so it will be delivered to your endpoint. You can verify this by checking the **Messages** tab in the Sequin web console:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/new-message-after-insert.png" alt="Messages tab" />
        </Frame>

    3. Update an existing region:

        ```bash
        UPDATE public.regions SET timezone = 'pst' WHERE id = 1;
        ```

        Again, this row also matches the filter of your Webhook Subscription, so it will be delivered to your endpoint.

    4. Finally, create a new region that doesn't match the filter:

        ```bash
        INSERT INTO public.regions (name, timezone) VALUES ('ca-west-1', 'mst');
        ```

        This row doesn't match the filter of your Webhook Subscription, so it won't be delivered to your endpoint. You can verify this by navigating to the **Databases** tab, selecting the `playground` database, and then clicking on the **Messages** tab:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/filtered-out-message-trace.png" alt="Messages tab" />
        </Frame>

    <Check>
    You've seen how changes in your database flow through Sequin and how you can trace your messages end to end.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

You are running Sequin and have setup a Webhook Subscription that both backfilled a table and will send you rows as they are created or updated. Now you can see how to instead _pull_ changes with the Consumer Group API. Or, you can skip ahead to see how to capture every discrete change that happens to tables in your database:
