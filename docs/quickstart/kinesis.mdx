In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You'll:

- Set up a Kinesis stream using the AWS CLI
- Create an IAM user with the minimal required permissions
- Boot Sequin and connect to a sample playground database
- Configure Sequin to stream database changes to your Kinesis stream
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and Kinesis.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials
- An AWS account with permissions to create Kinesis streams and IAM users

## Step 1: Set up your Kinesis stream

First, let's create a Kinesis stream and the necessary AWS resources using the AWS CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Kinesis stream">
    Run this command to create a new Kinesis stream called `sequin-quickstart`:

    ```bash
    aws kinesis create-stream \
      --stream-name sequin-quickstart \
      --shard-count 1
    ```

    Wait for the stream to become active (this takes about 1-2 minutes):

    ```bash
    aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name sequin-quickstart
    ```

    Look for `"StreamStatus": "ACTIVE"` in the response.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your stream ARN">
    Once active, note down your stream ARN from the describe-stream output. It will look like:
    
    ```
    arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/sequin-quickstart
    ```

    You can also get just the ARN with:

    ```bash
    aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name sequin-quickstart --query 'StreamDescription.StreamARN' --output text
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an IAM policy">
    Create a policy file called `sequin-kinesis-policy.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "kinesis:PutRecords",
            "kinesis:DescribeStream"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesis:*:*:stream/sequin-quickstart"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Create the policy in AWS:

    ```bash
    aws iam create-policy \
      --policy-name SequinKinesisPolicy \
      --policy-document file://sequin-kinesis-policy.json
    ```

    Note the policy ARN from the response - you'll need it in the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an IAM user">
    Create a dedicated IAM user for Sequin:

    ```bash
    aws iam create-user --user-name sequin-kinesis-user
    ```

    Attach the policy to the user (replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with your AWS account ID):

    ```bash
    aws iam attach-user-policy \
      --user-name sequin-kinesis-user \
      --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/SequinKinesisPolicy
    ```

    If you don't have your account ID handy, you can ask AWS like this:

    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create access keys">
    Generate access keys for the user:

    ```bash
    aws iam create-access-key --user-name sequin-kinesis-user
    ```

    **Important**: Save the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` from the response - you'll need these for Sequin configuration and they won't be shown again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <QuickstartInitialSteps />
  <Step title="Create a Kinesis Sink" icon="aws">
    With the playground database connected, create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview) that will send changes to your Kinesis stream:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
        Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select sink type">
        Select "Amazon Kinesis" as the sink type and click "Continue".
      </Step>

      <QuickstartSourceStep />
      <QuickstartBackfillStep />

      <Step title='Configure Kinesis connection'>
        In the Kinesis configuration card, enter:
        
        - **Stream ARN**: The ARN you noted from Step 1 (e.g., `arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/sequin-quickstart`)
        - **AWS Access Key ID**: The `AccessKeyId` from Step 1
        - **AWS Secret Access Key**: The `SecretAccessKey` from Step 1
        - **AWS Region**: The region where you created your stream (e.g., `us-east-1`)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create the sink">
        Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your Kinesis sink.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to your Kinesis stream" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to your stream.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Messages tab">
        Click the "Messages" tab to see recently delivered messages.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify in AWS (optional)">
        You can also verify data is flowing by checking your Kinesis stream in the AWS Console or using the CLI:

        ```bash
        aws kinesis get-records \
          --shard-iterator $(aws kinesis get-shard-iterator \
            --stream-name sequin-quickstart \
            --shard-id shardId-000000000000 \
            --shard-iterator-type TRIM_HORIZON \
            --query 'ShardIterator' --output text) \
          --query 'Records[0].Data' --output text | base64 -d
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Great work!
</Check>

You've successfully:

- Created a Kinesis stream with the AWS CLI
- Set up an IAM user with minimal required permissions
- Connected Sequin to stream Postgres changes to Kinesis
- Loaded existing data through a backfill
- Verified changes are flowing to your Kinesis stream

## Clean up (optional)

If you want to clean up the AWS resources created in this quickstart:

```bash
# Delete the Kinesis stream
aws kinesis delete-stream --stream-name sequin-quickstart

# Detach policy from user
aws iam detach-user-policy \
  --user-name sequin-kinesis-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/SequinKinesisPolicy

# Delete access key (replace with your actual access key ID)
aws iam delete-access-key \
  --user-name sequin-kinesis-user \
  --access-key-id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID

# Delete user and policy
aws iam delete-user --user-name sequin-kinesis-user
aws iam delete-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/SequinKinesisPolicy
```

## Ready to stream

Now you're ready to connect your own database to Sequin and start streaming changes:
