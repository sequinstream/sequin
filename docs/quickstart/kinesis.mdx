import QuickstartInitialSteps from '/snippets/quickstart-initial-steps.mdx';

In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database
- Configure a Kinesis stream to receive database changes
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and Kinesis.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with a Kinesis stream
- IAM credentials with `kinesis:PutRecords` permissions

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <QuickstartInitialSteps />
  <Step title="Create a Kinesis Sink" icon="aws">
    With the playground database connected, create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview) that will send changes to your Kinesis stream:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
        Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select sink type">
        Select "Amazon Kinesis" as the sink type and click "Continue".
      </Step>

      <Step title='Note "Source" configuration'>
        In the "Source" card, note that the `sequin-playground` database and `products` table are pre-selected. Leave these defaults:

        <Frame>
          <img style={{ maxWidth: '500px' }} src="/images/quickstart/source-card.png" alt="Source card showing the sequin_playground database and products table" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Setup a backfill">
        Toggle open the "Initial backfill" card and select "Backfill all rows":

        <Frame>
          <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/backfill-card.png" alt="Initial backfill card, backfill toggled on" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title='Configure Kinesis'>
        In the Kinesis configuration card, enter your stream ARN and AWS credentials.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create the sink">
        Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your Kinesis sink.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to your Kinesis stream" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to your stream.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Messages tab">
        Click the "Messages" tab to see recently delivered messages.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Great work!
</Check>

You've successfully:

- Set up a complete Postgres change data capture pipeline
- Loaded existing data through a backfill
- Verified changes are flowing to your Kinesis stream

## Ready to stream

Now you're ready to connect your own database to Sequin and start streaming changes:
