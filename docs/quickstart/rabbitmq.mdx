import QuickstartSourceStep from '/snippets/quickstart-source-step.mdx';
import QuickstartBackfillStep from '/snippets/quickstart-backfill-step.mdx';

In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to RabbitMQ. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database
- Configure RabbitMQ to receive database changes
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and RabbitMQ.

<Tip>
  This is the quickstart for streaming Postgres to RabbitMQ. See the [how-to guide](/how-to/stream-postgres-to-rabbitmq) for an explanation of how to use the RabbitMQ sink or the [reference](/reference/sinks/rabbitmq) for details on all configuration options.
</Tip>

<Steps titleSize="h2">
 <Step title="Boot RabbitMQ" icon="database">
  If you don't already have RabbitMQ running, start it with Docker:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name rabbitmq \
    -p 5672:5672 \
    -p 15672:15672 \
    rabbitmq:3-management
  ```

  This starts RabbitMQ with the management plugin enabled, which we'll use to set up our exchange and queue.

  <Note>
    If you're using another RabbitMQ instance, ensure you have the connection details ready.
  </Note>
 </Step>

 <Step title="Configure RabbitMQ" icon="gear">
  Before creating our sink, we need to set up RabbitMQ to receive messages. We'll:
  1. Create an exchange
  2. Create a queue
  3. Bind the queue to the exchange

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open RabbitMQ Management UI">
      Open http://localhost:15672 in your browser. Login with:
      - Username: guest
      - Password: guest
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create an exchange">
      1. Click "Exchanges" in the top navigation
      2. Find the "Add a new exchange" accordion and expand it if needed
      3. Enter:
         - Name: sequin
         - Type: topic
         - Leave other settings as default
      4. Click "Add exchange"

      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a queue">
      1. Click "Queues and streams" in the top navigation
      2. Find the "Add a new queue" accordion and expand it if needed
      3. Enter:
         - Name: products
         - Leave other settings as default
      4. Click "Add queue"

      <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/rabbitmq/add-queue.png" alt="Adding a new queue in RabbitMQ" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>



    <Step title="Create a binding">
      1. On the "Queues and streams" page, click on your new "products" queue
      2. Find the "Bindings" section and expand it if needed
      3. In "Add binding to this queue", enter:
         - From exchange: sequin
         - Routing key: `sequin.changes.sequin-playground.public.products.*`
      4. Click "Bind"

      This routing key pattern will match all changes to the products table. The format is:
      `sequin.changes.<database>.<schema>.<table>.<action>`

        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/rabbitmq/add-binding.png" alt="Adding a binding in RabbitMQ" />
      </Frame>


      <Check>
        You've successfully created an exchange, queue, and binding in RabbitMQ.

 <Step title="Create a RabbitMQ Sink" icon="database">
  With the playground database connected and RabbitMQ configured, you can create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview). This sink will send changes to the `products` table to your RabbitMQ exchange:

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
      Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select sink type">
      Select "RabbitMQ" as the sink type and click "Continue".
    </Step>

    <QuickstartSourceStep />
    <QuickstartBackfillStep />

    <Step title='Configure "RabbitMQ Configuration"'>
      In the "RabbitMQ Configuration" card, enter your connection details:

      - Host: If running locally with Docker, use `host.docker.internal`
      - Port: The port RabbitMQ is listening on (default: 5672)
      - Exchange: The exchange name we created earlier (`sequin`)
      - Username and Password: Leave blank
      - SSL: Leave disabled

        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-config-card.png" alt="RabbitMQ configuration card" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test the connection">
      At the bottom of the form, click the "Test Connection" button. If you provided proper credentials, it should succeed.

      <Check>
        Sequin can connect to your RabbitMQ server.
      </Check>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the sink">
      You can leave the rest of the defaults. As configured, messages will first flow for all existing rows in the `products` table. Then, you'll receive all changes to the `products` table in real-time.

      Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your RabbitMQ sink.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
 </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow through RabbitMQ" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to RabbitMQ.

    Let's confirm messages are flowing:

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Messages tab">
      Click the "Messages" tab. You'll see a list of the recently delivered messages:

      <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/rabbitmq/messages-tab.png" alt="List of recently delivered messages" />
      </Frame>

      <Check>
        Sequin indicates it backfilled the `products` table to RabbitMQ.
      </Check>
    </Step>
      <Step title="View in RabbitMQ">
        You can view messages in your queue using the RabbitMQ management UI or CLI:

        ```bash
        docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqadmin get queue=products count=5 --format=pretty_json
        ```

        You should see the messages that were sent from Sequin. These are [`read` events](/reference/messages) from the initial backfill of the `products` table:

        <Frame>
          <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/rabbitmq/messages-in-queue.png" alt="Messages in the products queue" />
        </Frame>

        <Check>
          Messages are flowing from Sequin to RabbitMQ.
        </Check>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make some changes">
        Let's make some changes to the `products` table and see them flow through RabbitMQ.

        In your terminal, run the following command to insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        Check your queue for the new message:

        ```bash
        docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqadmin get queue=products count=10 --format=pretty_json
        ```

        You should see a message corresponding to the inserted row.

        Feel free to try other changes:

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change will appear in your RabbitMQ queue within a few seconds.

        <Info>
          If you want to purge your RabbitMQ queue, you can do so by running:

          ```bash
          docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqadmin purge queue name=products
          ```
        </Info>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Great work!
