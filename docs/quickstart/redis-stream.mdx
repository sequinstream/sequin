description: '`XADD` Postgres changes to Redis Streams in minutes. Build real-time data pipelines with Redis and Postgres change data capture (CDC).'

import QuickstartInitialSteps from '/snippets/quickstart-initial-steps.mdx';
import QuickstartSourceStep from '/snippets/quickstart-source-step.mdx';
import QuickstartBackfillStep from '/snippets/quickstart-backfill-step.mdx';

In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to a Redis stream. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database
- Configure a Redis stream to receive database changes
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and Redis Streams.

<Tip>
  This is the quickstart for streaming Postgres to Redis Streams. See the [how-to guide](/how-to/stream-postgres-to-redis-stream) for an explanation of how to use the Redis Stream sink or the [reference](/reference/sinks/redis-stream) for details on all configuration options.
</Tip>

<Info>
  This guide is for Redis Streams which use `XADD` to build a stream. If you are want to use Redis key/values, see our [Redis String quickstart](/quickstart/redis-string).

<Steps titleSize="h2">
 <Step title="Boot Redis" icon="database">
  If you don't already have Redis running, start Redis with Docker:

  ```bash
  docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:latest
  ```

  <Note>
    If you're using another Redis instance, be sure you're using Redis 5.0+ (required for streams).
  </Note>
 </Step>

 <Step title="Create a Redis Stream Sink" icon="database">
  With the playground database connected, you can create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview). This sink will send changes to the `products` table to your Redis stream:

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
      Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select sink type">
      Select "Redis Stream" as the sink type and click "Continue".
    </Step>

    <QuickstartSourceStep />
    <QuickstartBackfillStep />

    <Step title='Configure "Redis Configuration"'>
      In the "Redis Configuration" card, enter your Redis connection details.

      - Host: If running locally with Docker, use `host.docker.internal`
      - Port: The port Redis is listening on (default: 6379)
      - Username: Required if Redis authentication is enabled
      - Password: Required if Redis authentication is enabled
      - Stream Key: The Redis stream to write to (e.g., `products-stream`)
      - Database: The Redis database number (default: 0)
      - TLS: Toggle on if your Redis instance requires TLS

      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test the connection">
      At the bottom of the form, click the "Test Connection" button. If you provided proper credentials, it should succeed.

      <Check>
        Sequin can connect to your Redis instance.
      </Check>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the sink">
      You can leave the rest of the defaults. As configured, the Redis stream will first receive a backfill of all rows currently in the `products` table. Then, it will receive all changes to the `products` table in real-time.

      Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your Redis Stream sink.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
 </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to your Redis stream" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to your Redis stream.

    Let's confirm messages are flowing:

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Messages tab">
      Click the "Messages" tab. You'll see a list of the recently delivered messages:

      <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/redis-stream/messages-tab.png" alt="List of recently delivered messages" />
      </Frame>

      <Check>
        Sequin indicates it backfilled the `products` table to your Redis stream.
      </Check>
    </Step>
      <Step title="View in Redis CLI">
        Connect to your Redis instance using the Redis CLI and read from the stream:

        ```bash
        redis-cli
        > xread count 5 streams playground-stream 0
        ```

        You should see the messages that were sent from Sequin. These are [`read` events](/reference/messages) from the initial backfill of the `products` table.

        <Check>
          Messages are flowing from Sequin to your Redis stream.
        </Check>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make some changes">
        Let's make some changes to the `products` table and see them flow to your stream.

        In your terminal, run the following command to insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        In Redis CLI, read the latest messages from the stream:

        ```bash
        xrevrange playground-stream + - count 1
        ```

        You should see a message corresponding to the inserted row.

        Feel free to try other changes:

          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change will appear in your Redis stream within a few seconds.
      </Step>
