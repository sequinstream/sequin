description: '`SET` and `DEL` Postgres changes to Redis key/values in minutes. Build a real-time Redis cache from your Postgres data with change data capture (CDC).'
---

import QuickstartInitialSteps from '/snippets/quickstart-initial-steps.mdx';

In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to a Redis database. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database 
- Configure Redis to receive database changes
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) to Redis with Sequin.

<Info>
  This guide is for Redis Strings which use `SET` and `DEL` to maintain a cache. If you want to use Redis Streams, see our [Redis Streams quickstart](/quickstart/redis-stream).
</Info>

<Steps titleSize="h2">
 <Step title="Boot Redis" icon="database">
  If you don't already have Redis running, start Redis with Docker:

  ```bash
  docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:latest
  ```

  Test your Redis connection with:
  
  ```bash
  redis-cli ping
  ```
  
  You should see "PONG" in response.
 </Step>

 <Step title="Create a Redis String Sink" icon="database">
  With the playground database connected, you can create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview). This sink will maintain a Redis cache that mirrors your Postgres `products` table:

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
      Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select sink type">
      Select "Redis String" as the sink type and click "Continue".
    </Step>

    <Step title='Note "Source" configuration'>
      In the "Source" card, note that the `sequin-playground` database and `products` table are pre-selected. Leave these defaults:

        <img style={{ maxWidth: '500px' }} src="/images/quickstart/source-card.png" alt="Source card showing the sequin_playground database and products table" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Setup a backfill">
      Toggle open the "Initial backfill" card and select "Backfill all rows":

      <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/backfill-card.png" alt="Initial backfill card, backfill toggled on" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add a transform function">
      Open the **Transform** card, click **+ Create new transform** and use the following Elixir function in a [Transform function](/reference/transforms#function-transform):

      ```elixir
      def transform(action, record, changes, metadata) do
        record
      end
      ```

      Name the transform `record-only` and click **Create function**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the transform">
      Navigate back to the **Sinks** tab and select the transform function you just created.

      <Info>
        If you don't see the transform function you just created, click the refresh button.
      </Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title='Configure "Redis Configuration"'>
      In the "Redis Configuration" card, enter your Redis connection details.

      - Host: If running locally with Docker, use `host.docker.internal`
      - Port: The port Redis is listening on (default: 6379)

      Leave the rest of the fields with their default values.

        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/redis-string/redis-config-card.png" alt="Redis configuration card" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test the connection">
      At the bottom of the form, click the "Test Connection" button. With the above configuration, it should succeed.

      <Check>
        Sequin can connect to your Redis instance.
      </Check>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the sink">
      As configured, Sequin will:
      
      1. Backfill all current rows into Redis as key/value pairs
      2. Set up real-time replication so any changes to the `products` table will be reflected in Redis immediately
      3. Use primary keys from Postgres to form Redis keys (e.g., `sequin:products:1`, `sequin:products:2`)

      Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your Redis String sink.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
 </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to your Redis cache" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to your Redis cache.

    Let's confirm the cache is working:

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Messages tab">
      Click the "Messages" tab. You'll see a list of the recently delivered messages:

      <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/redis-string/messages-tab.png" alt="List of recently delivered messages" />
      </Frame>

      <Check>
        Sequin indicates it backfilled the `products` table to your Redis cache.
      </Check>
    </Step>
      <Step title="View in Redis CLI">
        Connect to your Redis instance using the Redis CLI:

        ```bash
        redis-cli
        ```

        Then list the products in your Redis cache:

        ```bash
        KEYS sequin:products:*
        ```

        You should see a list of keys corresponding to products from your Postgres table.

        Now, let's look at the actual data for one product:

        ```bash
        GET sequin:products:1
        ```

        You should see a JSON representation of the product data.

        <Check>
          Data from Postgres is now cached in Redis as strings.
        </Check>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make some changes">
        Let's make some changes to the `products` table and see them reflected in your Redis cache.

        In your terminal, run the following command to insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        In Redis CLI, check if the new product was added to the cache:

        ```bash
        KEYS sequin:products:*
        ```

        You should see a new key for the product you just added. View its contents:

        ```bash
        GET sequin:products:[new-id]
        ```

        Replace `[new-id]` with the ID of the newly inserted product.

        Feel free to try other changes:

          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
            
            Then check the updated value in Redis:
            ```bash
            # Find the product ID first
            redis-cli --raw KEYS "sequin:products:*" | xargs -I {} redis-cli --raw GET {} | grep "Avocados (3 pack)"
            
            # Then get the specific product (replace ID with the one you found)
            GET sequin:products:[id]
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
            
            Verify the change in Redis:
            ```bash
            # Use the same product ID from the previous example
            GET sequin:products:[id]
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
            
            Check that the key was removed from Redis:
            ```bash
            # Find the product ID first (if you don't already know it)
            redis-cli --raw KEYS "sequin:products:*" | xargs -I {} redis-cli --raw GET {} | grep "Blueberries"
            ```
            
            This should return an empty list, indicating the key was removed.
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change to your Postgres database will be automatically reflected in your Redis cache within a few seconds.

You've successfully:

- Set up a complete Postgres to Redis cache synchronization pipeline
- Loaded existing data through a backfill
- Made changes to the `products` table
- Verified Redis cache updates automatically with your database changes

## Applications of Redis Strings Sink

Redis Strings are incredibly versatile and can be used for various caching scenarios:

- **Fast lookups**: Redis can serve product details much faster than a database query
- **Multi-region caching**: Use Sequin to sync records from your primary database to Redis in multiple regions
- **Cache invalidation**: Configure your Redis cache with infinite retention and rely on Sequin to SET and DEL keys as records are updated or deleted

## Ready to stream

Now you're ready to connect your own database to Sequin and start streaming changes:
