In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to an S2 stream. You'll:

- Set up an S2 stream using the S2 web console and CLI
- Boot Sequin and connect to a sample playground database
- Configure Sequin to stream database changes to your S2 stream
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and S2.

## Prerequisites

- A [S2 cloud account](https://s2.dev/sign-up)
- The [S2 CLI](https://s2.dev/docs/quickstart#get-started-with-the-cli) installed

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Set up your S2 stream" icon="s">
    First, let's create an S2 stream

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an S2 Access Token">
        In the [S2 web console](https://s2.dev/dashboard), navigate to the "Access Tokens" section and click the "+ Issue" button to generate a new token.

        Save this token to a secure location as you'll need it to configure the S2 CLI and your Sequin S2 sink.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create an S2 Basin">
        Navigate to the ["Basins" tab](https://s2.dev/dashboard/basins) and click the "+ Create Basin" button. Enter a name for your basin (e.g. `sequin-quickstart`) and accept the default settings. Click the "Create Basin" button to create your basin.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create an S2 Stream">
        Select the basin you just created and click the "+ Create Stream" button. Name your stream `products` and accept the default settings. Click the "Create Stream" button to create your stream.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Connect to your S2 stream using the S2 CLI">
        Now, open your terminal and configure the S2 CLI with your access token:

        ```bash
        s2 config set access-token <your-access-token>
        ```

        Then, begin reading from your stream:

        ```bash
        s2 read s2://{{your-basin-name}}/products

        $
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Check>
      Your S2 stream is now ready to receive data.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <QuickstartInitialSteps />
  <Step title="Create a S2 Sink" icon="s">
    With the playground database connected, create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview) that will send changes to your S2 stream:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
        Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select sink type">
        Select "S2" as the sink type and click "Continue".
      </Step>

      <QuickstartSourceStep />
      <QuickstartBackfillStep />

      <Step title='Configure S2 connection'>
        In the S2 configuration card, enter:

        - **Basin**: The name of the basin you created previously
        - **Stream**: The name of the stream you created previously
        - **Access Token**: The access token for the S2 account associated with the basin and stream
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create the sink">
        Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your S2 sink.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to your S2 stream" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to your stream.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Messages tab">
        Click the "Messages" tab to see recently delivered messages.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify in S2">
        Return to your terminal and you should see the data flowing into your S2 stream.

        ```bash
        s2 read s2://sequin-quickstart/products
        â¦¿ 3500 bytes (6 records in range 6..=11)
        {"record":{"id":1,"inserted_at":"2025-06-11T01:19:22.402358","name":"Avocados (3 pack)","price":"5.99","updated_at":"2025-06-11T01:19:22.402358"},"metadata":{"consumer":{"id":"282713d8-76c4-42db-8e16-3e0df04cc5f6","name":"sequin-playground-s2-sink","annotations":null},"table_name":"products","commit_timestamp":"2025-06-17T19:19:51.955551Z","commit_lsn":null,"commit_idx":null,"transaction_annotations":null,"table_schema":"public","idempotency_key":"ODQ5NWNhMzEtYTM0MC00MDI5LThjODItMTcxYmRjMmY4YjI2OjE=","database_name":"sequin-playground"},"action":"read","changes":null}
        {"record":{"id":2,"inserted_at":"2025-06-11T01:19:22.402358","name":"Flank Steak (1 lb)","price":"8.99","updated_at":"2025-06-11T01:19:22.402358"},"metadata":{"consumer":{"id":"282713d8-76c4-42db-8e16-3e0df04cc5f6","name":"sequin-playground-s2-sink","annotations":null},"table_name":"products","commit_timestamp":"2025-06-17T19:19:51.955968Z","commit_lsn":null,"commit_idx":null,"transaction_annotations":null,"table_schema":"public","idempotency_key":"ODQ5NWNhMzEtYTM0MC00MDI5LThjODItMTcxYmRjMmY4YjI2OjI=","database_name":"sequin-playground"},"action":"read","changes":null}
        ...
        ```

        <Check>
          Messages are flowing from Sequin to your S2 stream.
        </Check>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make some changes">
        Let's make some changes to the `products` table and see them flow to your S2 stream.

        In a new terminal window, run the following command to insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        Back in your S2 stream, you should see a new message appear in the request log:

        ```bash
        {"record":{"id":7,"inserted_at":"2025-06-17T21:03:40.350239","name":"Organic Honey (16 oz)","price":"12.99","updated_at":"2025-06-17T21:03:40.350239"},"metadata":{"consumer":{"id":"282713d8-76c4-42db-8e16-3e0df04cc5f6","name":"sequin-playground-s2-sink","annotations":{}},"table_name":"products","commit_timestamp":"2025-06-17T21:03:40.355455Z","commit_lsn":73220408,"commit_idx":0,"transaction_annotations":null,"table_schema":"public","idempotency_key":"NzMyMjA0MDg6MA==","database_name":"sequin-playground"},"action":"insert","changes":null}
        ```

        Feel free to try other changes:

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change will appear in your S2 stream within a few seconds.

- Verified changes are flowing to your S2 stream

## Ready to stream

Now you're ready to connect your own database to Sequin and start streaming changes:
