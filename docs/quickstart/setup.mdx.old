<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Run Sequin" icon="server">
    The easiest way to run and test Sequin is with our Docker Compose file. This file starts a Postgres database, Redis instance, and Sequin server.

    1. Git clone the repository:

        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
        ```

    2. Navigate to the `docker` directory:

        ```bash
        cd sequin/docker
        ```

    3. Run `docker compose up -d`:

        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```

    4. Verify the containers are running:

        ```bash
        docker compose ps
        ```

    <Note>
    For more configuration options, including running Sequin on an existing Postgres and Redis instance or within an existing project, see our [Docker setup](/self-hosting/docker-setup).
    </Note>

  <Step title="Login" icon="key">
    The Docker Compose file automatically configures Sequin with an admin user, a playground database, and a sample stream.

    <Note>
    The Docker Compose uses a configuration file to provision these resources. You can view the file at `/docker/playground.yml`.
    </Note>

    1. After starting the Docker Compose services, open the Sequin web console at [http://localhost:7376](http://localhost:7376):

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/login-page.png" alt="Sequin login page, allowing login with default credentials" />
        </Frame>

    2. Login with the default credentials:
        - Email: `admin@sequinstream.com`
        - Password: `sequinpassword!`
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the playground database" icon="database">
    To help you try Sequin quickly, Sequin's Docker Compose file creates a logical database called `sequin_playground` with a sample dataset in the `public.regions` table. The Sequin server automatically connects to this database.

    1. In the Sequin web console, click **Databases** in the sidebar.
    2. Click on the pre-configured `sequin-playground` database.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/quickstart/playground-database.png" alt="Playground database" />
    </Frame>

    The database should be healthy and ready to use.

  </Step>
  <Step title="View the regions stream" icon="list">
    Now, view the pre-configured `regions` stream:

    1. In the Sequin web console, click **Streams** in the sidebar.

    2. The `public.regions` table should already have a [Stream](/how-sequin-works#streams) configured.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Ready to stream

<Check>
You are ready to stream!
</Check>

You are running Sequin, connected to a playground database, and have a Stream setup for the `regions` table. Now for the fun part â€“ streaming! You can stream rows via a Webhook Subscription or the Consumer Group API:
