In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to an Amazon SNS topic. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database  
- Create an SNS topic and subscription
- Set up a sink to sync changes to SNS
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and SNS. This same pattern can be used to setup your own Postgres CDC pipeline with SNS.

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <QuickstartInitialSteps />

  <Step title="Create an SNS topic" icon="database">
    We'll start by creating an Amazon SNS topic that will receive change events from Sequin.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the SNS console">
        Sign in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon SNS console</a>. Make sure you're in the AWS region where you want to create your topic.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create the topic">
        Click "Create topic".

        For the type, select "Standard". For name, enter <code>products-updates</code>.

        Leave the rest of the defaults and click "Create topic".
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a subscription" icon="envelope">
    We'll create an email subscription so you can see notifications arrive in your inbox:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Subscribe an email endpoint">
        On the topic overview page click "Create subscription".

        Set "Protocol" to "Email" and enter your email address in the "Endpoint" field.

        Click "Create Subscription".
      </Step>

      <Step title="Confirm the subscription">
        Check your email inbox for a message from Amazon SNS and click the "Confirm subscription" link.

        Once confirmed, the subscription's <i>Status</i> will change to <code>Confirmed</code> in the SNS console.

        <Note>
          If you don't see the confirmation email, check your spam folder.

          You can re-send the confirmation email by clicking "Request confirmation" in the SNS console.
        </Note>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an SNS Sink" icon="plug">
    With the playground database connected and your SNS topic ready, you can create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview) in Sequin. This sink will send changes from the <code>products</code> table to your SNS topic:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
        In Sequin, click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select sink type">
        Select "Amazon SNS" as the sink type and click "Continue".
      </Step>

      <QuickstartSourceStep />
      <QuickstartBackfillStep />

      <Step title='Configure SNS'>
        In the SNS card, enter your configuration:

        - Topic ARN: the ARN of the SNS topic you created earlier
        - AWS Access Key ID / Secret Access Key: credentials that have permission to publish to the topic

        <Note>
          If you don't have credentials, you can create a new user for Sequin with [write permissions to SNS](/reference/sinks/sns#iam-user-permissions).
        </Note>

          <img src="/images/quickstart/sns/config-card.png" alt="SNS configuration card" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create the sink">
        Give your sink a name, like <code>products-sns</code>, and click "Create Sink".

        Sequin will first backfill the rows in the `products` table, then stream every change in realâ€‘time to your SNS topic.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See backfill messages in Sequin" icon="waveform-lines">
    With our initial backfill complete, click the "Messages" tab to see the status of backfill messages. All messages will be marked as "Delivered":

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/quickstart/sns/messages-tab.png" alt="Backfill messages in Sequin" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See backfill notifications in your email" icon="waveform-lines">
    Check your email inbox. You should see an email for each backfill message. The email contains a JSON payload with the backfilled data. Sequin's message is under the `Message` field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to SNS" icon="waveform-lines">
    Now, see how changes flow to SNS in real-time:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Make some changes">
        In your terminal insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        The change should flow through SNS to your email inbox in a few seconds.

        Feel free to try other changes:

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change will be forwarded to your email inbox via SNS within a few seconds.
      </Step>

## Ready to stream

Now you're ready to connect your own database to Sequin and start streaming changes:
