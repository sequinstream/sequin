In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to a Typesense collection. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database
- Create a Typesense collection
- Set up a sink to sync changes to Typesense
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin and Typesense. This same pattern can be used to setup your own Postgres CDC pipeline with Typesense.

 <QuickstartInitialSteps />
 <Step title="Create a Typesense Collection" icon="database">
  First, let's start Typesense and create a collection to store our product data:

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Start Typesense">
     Typesense offers a docker image that can be run locally. Let's start it up:

      ```bash
      docker run -d \
        --name typesense-server \
        -p 8108:8108 \
        -v ./typesense-data:/data \
        --restart on-failure \
        typesense/typesense:28.0 \
        --data-dir /data \
        --api-key=my-api-key \
        --enable-cors
      ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the collection">
      Run the following command to create a new collection called "products":

      ```bash
      curl -X POST http://localhost:8108/collections \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: my-api-key" \
        -d '{
          "name": "products",
          "fields": [
            {"name": ".*", "type": "auto" }
          ]
        }'
      ```

      This creates a collection that will automatically detect field types from our data.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify the collection">
      You can verify the collection was created by searching it:

      ```bash
      curl -X GET "http://localhost:8108/collections/products/documents/search?q=*" \
        -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: my-api-key"
      ```

      The collection should be empty initially.

      ```
      {
        "found": 0,
        "hits": [],
        "out_of": 6,
        "page": 1
      }
      ```
    </Step>
  </Steps>
 </Step>

 <Step title="Create a Typesense Sink" icon="plug">
  With the playground database connected and Typesense collection created, you can create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview). This sink will send changes to the `products` table to your Typesense collection:

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
      Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select sink type">
      Select "Typesense" as the sink type and click "Continue".
    </Step>

    <QuickstartSourceStep />

    <Step title="Setup a transform">
      In the [Transform](/reference/transforms) card, click the toggle to view existing transforms. None exist, so click "+ Create new transform" which will open a window for creating a new transform.

      For "Transform name", put `products-typesense`. For "Transform type", select "Transform function".

      In the "Transform function" field, input the following code:

      ```elixir
      def transform(action, record, changes, metadata) do
        Map.take(record, ["id", "name", "price"])
      end
      ```

      This transform will take the `id`, `name`, and `price` fields from the `products` table and use them to create a new document in Typesense.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/typesense/transform-card.png" alt="Transform card with Elixir transform" />
      </Frame>

       Click "Create Transform".

       You can close the transform tab and navigate back to the Typesense sink create page.

       Now, select the `products-typesense` transform in the "Transform" list. (If you don't see it, click the refresh icon.)
    </Step>

    <QuickstartBackfillStep />

    <Step title='Configure Typesense'>
      In the Typesense card, enter your Typesense configuration:

      - Host: `http://host.docker.internal:8108`
      - Collection: `products`
      - API Key: `my-api-key`

      You can leave the rest of the defaults.


      <Frame>
        <img  src="/images/quickstart/typesense/config-card-2.png" alt="Typesense configuration card" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the sink">
      Give your sink a name, like `products-typesense`, and click "Create Sink".

      As configured, the Typesense collection will first receive a backfill of all rows currently in the `products` table. Then, it will receive all changes to the `products` table in real-time.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
 </Step>

  <Step title="Query your data in Typesense" icon="waveform-lines">
    With our initial backfill complete, we can now query Typesense for our `products` collection:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8108/collections/products/documents/search?q=*" \
      -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: my-api-key"
    ```

    This query will return all documents in the `products` collection.

    To query for just products matching "avocado", we can add a `name` parameter to the query:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8108/collections/products/documents/search?q=avocado&query_by=name" \
        -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: my-api-key"
    ```

    This query returns all documents in the `products` collection where the `name` field matches "avocado".
  </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to Typesense" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to Typesense.

    Let's confirm data is flowing by making some changes and searching in Typesense:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Make some changes">
        Let's make some changes to the `products` table and see them flow to Typesense.

        In your terminal, run the following command to insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        After a few seconds, search for the new product in Typesense:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "http://localhost:8108/collections/products/documents/search?q=honey&query_by=name" \
          -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: my-api-key"
        ```

        You should see the new product appear in the search results.

        Feel free to try other changes:

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change will be reflected in Typesense within a few seconds. Try searching for the modified or deleted products to verify the changes.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Try fuzzy search">
        Typesense supports fuzzy search with typo tolerance. Try searching with a typo:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "http://localhost:8108/collections/products/documents/search?q=steak&query_by=name&num_typos=1" \
          -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: my-api-key"
        ```

        Even with a typo, you should still find relevant products.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>
