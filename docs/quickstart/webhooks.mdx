In this quickstart, you'll create a real-time data pipeline that streams changes from a Postgres database to a webhook endpoint. You'll:

- Boot Sequin
- Connect to a sample playground database
- Create a webhook that receives database changes
- See your changes flow in real-time

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience setting up Postgres change data capture (CDC) with Sequin. This same pattern can be used to setup your own Postgres CDC pipeline with a webhook endpoint.

<Steps titleSize="h2">
 <QuickstartInitialSteps />
 <Step title="Create a Webhook Sink" icon="plug">
  With the playground database connected, you can create a [sink](/reference/sinks/overview). This sink will send changes to the `products` table to an HTTP endpoint:

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Sinks">
      Click "Sinks" in the sidebar navigation, then click "Create Sink".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select sink type">
      Select "Webhook" as the sink type and click "Continue".
    </Step>

    <QuickstartSourceStep />
    <QuickstartBackfillStep />

    <Step title='Configure "HTTP Endpoint"'>
      In the "HTTP Endpoint" card, click the dropdown "New HTTP Endpoint" and select "Create webhook.site endpoint".

      This will provision a test endpoint on Webhook.site for you to use:

       <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/webhooks/http-endpoint-card.png" alt="Clicking to create a new Webhook.site endpoint" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the sink">
      You can leave the rest of the defaults. As configured, the webhook endpoint will first receive a backfill of all rows currently in the `products` table. Then, it will receive all changes to the `products` table in real-time.

      Click "Create Sink" to finish setting up your webhook.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
 </Step>

  <Step title="See changes flow to the webhook endpoint" icon="waveform-lines">
    On the new sink's overview page, you should see the "Health" status turn green, indicating data is flowing to the webhook endpoint.

    Let's confirm messages are flowing, both on Sequin and on Webhook.site:

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Messages tab">
      Click the "Messages" tab. You'll see a list of the recently delivered messages:

      <Frame>
        <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/webhooks/messages-tab.png" alt="List of recently delivered messages" />
      </Frame>

      <Check>
        Sequin indicates it backfilled the `products` table to our webhook endpoint.
      </Check>
    </Step>
      <Step title="View on Webhook.site">
        Navigate back to the "Overview" tab. On the "HTTP Endpoint" card, click "View on Webhook.site".

        This opens a new tab with the webhook endpoint's request log. You should see the most recently received message displayed:

        <Frame>
          <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/webhooks/webhook-site-messages.png" alt="Webhook.site request log" />
        </Frame>

        This message is a [`read` event](/reference/messages#change-messages) for a row in the `products` table. A `read` event indicates the event came from a Sequin backfill.

        <Check>
          Messages are flowing from Sequin to the webhook endpoint.
        </Check>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make some changes">
        Let's make some changes to the `products` table and see them flow to the webhook endpoint.

        In your terminal, run the following command to insert a new row into the `products` table:

        ```bash
        docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
          psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
          "insert into products (name, price) values ('Organic Honey (16 oz)', 12.99);"
        ```

        Back on Webhook.site, you should see a new message appear in the request log:


        <Frame>
          <img style={{ maxWidth: '700px' }} src="/images/quickstart/webhooks/webhook-site-inserted-message.png" alt="Recently inserted message on Webhook.site" />
        </Frame>

        Feel free to try other changes:

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Update a product's price">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set price = 7.99 where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Change a product's name">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "update products set name = 'Organic Avocados (3 pack)' where name = 'Avocados (3 pack)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Delete a product">
            ```bash
            docker exec -i sequin-sequin_postgres-1 \
              psql -U postgres -d sequin_playground -c \
              "delete from products where name = 'Blueberries (6 oz)';"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Each change will appear in Webhook.site within a few seconds.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Great work!

You've successfully:

- Set up a complete Postgres change data capture pipeline
- Loaded existing data through a backfill
- Made changes to the `products` table
- Verified changes are flowing to your webhook endpoint

## Ready to stream
