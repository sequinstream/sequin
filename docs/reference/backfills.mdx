A **backfill** is a process that streams current rows from a table to a sink.

You can use a backfill to:

- **Seed a sink**: Stream the current state of a table to a sink.
- **Replay**: Re-process rows that have already been sent to a sink.

## Creating a backfill

During sink creation, you can optionally specify a backfill. Sequin will run the backfill first, then continue to stream any changes to the sink.

After a sink is created, you can manually trigger a backfill on the sink's backfill tab at any time. You can backfill all tables or specific tables.

## Backfill messages

Sequin will send a [message](/reference/messages) with the action `read` for each row in the table.

<Note>
Backfills only include the current state of the row at the time of the backfill. You cannot backfill or replay atomic inserts, updates and deletes to your table.

To enable backfilling of specific inserts, updates and deletes, you can set up [change retention](/how-to/setup-change-retention).
</Note>


## Full and partial backfills

When creating a backfill, you can choose either:

- **Full backfill**: Stream the whole table.
- **Partial backfill**: Stream starting at a specific point in the table.

In both cases, Sequin will read rows from the table concurrently with capturing new changes.

### Partial backfills

To identify a specific point in the table you choose both a sort column and a start position for that column. For instance, if you choose `updated_at` as the sort column, you can specify a start position of `2025-01-01 00:00:00`.

<Info>
We highly recommend using a column that is indexed as the sort column.

Partial backfills are particularly useful for **disaster recovery**.

For instance, let's say that your Sequin instance is delivering data to AWS SQS. A bug in your SQS consumer code causes messages to be processed incorrectly from SQS for several hours. Once processed, messages are removed from SQS.

When you deploy a fix for the bug, you can use a **partial backfill** to replay the messages that were incorrectly processed.

These messages are then delivered to your sink, where they will be processed correctly by the updated consumer code.

## Backfill ordering

By default, backfills order rows by primary keys of the table. This ensures that `select` queries are performant, as primary keys are always indexed.

For partial backfills, you choose a sort column. Sequin will order rows by the sort column. You may choose any column as the sort column, but we strongly recommend using a column that is indexed.
