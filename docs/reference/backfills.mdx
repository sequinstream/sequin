A **backfill** is a process that streams current rows from a table to a sink.

You can use a backfill to:

- **Seed a sink**: Stream the current state of a table to a sink.
- **Replay**: Re-process rows that have already been sent to a sink.

## Creating a backfill

During sink creation, you can optionally specify a backfill. Sequin will run the backfill first, then continue to stream any changes to the sink.

After a sink is created, you can manually trigger a backfill on the sink's backfill tab at any time. You can backfill all tables or specific tables.

## Backfill messages

### Change messages

If you're sending [change messages](/reference/payloads#change-messages) to a sink, Sequin will send a `read` message for each row in the table.

Note that change messages are ephemeral. Once they're sent to a sink, they can't be replayed/backfilled.

To enable backfilling of change messages, you can set up [change retention](/how-to/setup-change-retention).


## Backfill configuration

When creating a backfill, you can indicate whether the backfill should:

- **Stream the whole table**.

    Sequin will backfill all rows currently in the table to the sink.

- **Stream starting at a specific point in the table**.

    When you add a source table to Sequin, you specify a sort column, like `updated_at`. You can specify a value for this column to start the backfill at (e.g. `updated_at >= '2024-01-01'`). Sequin will backfill all rows from the specified point to the end of the table.

## Backfill ordering

Backfills send rows to your sink in the order of the sort column that you specify for your source table. For example, if you specify `updated_at` as the sort column, Sequin will send rows to your sink ordered by `updated_at asc`.
