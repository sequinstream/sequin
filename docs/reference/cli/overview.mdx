With the Sequin CLI, you can easily build and test features locally. Use `sequin tunnel` to establish a connection between Sequin's cloud platform and your local development environment. You can use `sequin tunnel` to connect Sequin to either local databases or HTTP endpoints.

<Info>
At the moment, the only utility command available in the CLI is `tunnel`. More commands will be added in the future.

## Installation

### Install with Homebrew

```bash
brew tap sequinstream/sequin git@github.com:sequinstream/homebrew-sequin
brew install sequin
```

### Install with shell

```bash
curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequinstream/sequin/main/cli/installer.sh | sh
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
cd cli && make build
```

Reload your console and test that it's installed:

```bash
sequin --help
```

## Setup

Sequin CLI's **contexts** store settings and account information. The most important property in context is your API token. You can create a new context (called "default") like this:

```bash
sequin context add default --api-token={{my-token-from-sequinstream.com}} --set-default
```

After running this command, this API token will be included in future CLI commands by default.

If you have multiple contexts, you can specify a non-default context with a `context` flag:

```bash
sequin tunnel --ports=5432:my-pg-db --context=staging
```

## Tunnel

The `tunnel` command creates a secure connection between your local development environment and Sequin's cloud platform. You can use it to connect Sequin to either local databases or HTTP endpoints.

First, you'll need to setup your database or HTTP endpoint on [Sequin's platform](https://sequinstream.com).

Then, to start a tunnel, run the `tunnel` command. The docs for that command:

```bash
sequin tunnel --help
usage: sequin tunnel [<flags>]

Create tunnels to Sequin

Flags:
  --ports=PORTS  Ports to tunnel, in the format <local-port>:<name-or-id>[,<local-port>:<name-or-id>]
```

So, if you named your Postgres database `my-pg-db` on Sequin, and it's running on port 5432 on your local machine, run:

```bash
sequin tunnel --ports=5432:my-pg-db
```

Sequin's cloud servers can now connect to your local Postgres database at `localhost:5432`.
