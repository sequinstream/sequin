## Environment variables

The standard [Docker Compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequinstream/sequin/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml) includes sane defaults for [getting started quickly](/running-sequin).

You can configure Sequin by setting environment variables.

<Info>
  To see the file that loads and uses these environment variables, see [config/runtime.exs](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/blob/main/config/runtime.exs).
</Info>

### General configuration

- `SERVER_PORT`: Server port number (default: 7376)
  - This is the port that Sequin will listen on for incoming connections. It's the port for both the web console as well as the API.
- `SERVER_HOST`: Host name for the server
  - If you're hosting Sequin at a custom domain, you should set this to that domain.

### Configuration file

You can provide a YAML configuration file to Sequin. This configuration file will upsert databases, sinks, and other resources on boot.

- `CONFIG_FILE_PATH`: Path to configuration file
- `CONFIG_FILE_YAML`: YAML configuration content (base64 encoded)
  - If it's easier, you can provide the YAML directly as an environment variable. The YAML file must be base64 encoded.

### Postgres configuration

- `PG_URL`: Complete Postgres connection URL (alternative to individual PG_* variables below)
  - (e.g. `postgres://sequin:password@localhost:5432/sequin`)
- `PG_PORT`: Postgres port number (default: 5432)
- `PG_HOSTNAME`: Postgres host address
- `PG_DATABASE`: Database name
- `PG_USERNAME`: Database user
- `PG_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `PG_IPV6`: Enable IPv6 support (default: false)
- `PG_SSL`: Enable SSL for Postgres connection (default: false)
- `PG_POOL_SIZE`: Database connection pool size (default: 10)

#### `PG_POOL_SIZE`

The `PG_POOL_SIZE` variable controls the maximum number of concurrent connections that Sequin will maintain to Postgres. For higher throughput on larger Postgres instances, you should increase this value.

### Redis configuration

- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL
  - (e.g. `redis://localhost:6379`)
- `REDIS_IPV6`: Enable IPv6 support (default: false)

### Security configuration

- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Base secret key for encryption
- `VAULT_KEY`: Vault encryption key

See [secret generation](#secret-generation) for how to generate these values.

### Feature configuration

- `FEATURE_ACCOUNT_SELF_SIGNUP`: Enable account self-signup (default: enabled)
  - If disabled, users must be invited to the Sequin instance by an admin. Turn this setting off if you'll be hosting Sequin at a public URL.
- `FEATURE_PROVISION_DEFAULT_USER`: Enable default user provisioning (default: enabled)
  - By default, Sequin provisions a default user on startup if one doesn't exist. This is a convenience feature to get started quickly. If you're hosting Sequin at a public URL, you should consider either changing the password for this user or disabling this feature.
- `SEQUIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`: Disable telemetry data collection (default: false)
  - Sequin collects telemetry data by default. While we're early, this **greatly** helps us improve the product. To opt-out, set this to `true`.

### Email configuration

Email configuration is coming soon. [Please comment on this issue](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/issues/579) if you'd like to see this feature.

### OAuth configuration

To use GitHub OAuth as a sign-in/sign-up method, provide the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: GitHub OAuth client ID
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: GitHub OAuth client secret

### Monitoring/stats configuration

Monitoring/stats configuration is coming soon. [Please comment on this issue](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/issues/580) if you'd like to see this feature.

## Clustering

At the moment, Sequin does not support clustering. That means you should run Sequin as a **single-node** instance. [Please comment on this issue](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/issues/581) if you'd like high availability.

## Deploying to production

### Secret generation

{/* DOCSTODO: We think its 64 bytes for SECRET_KEY_BASE and base64 encoded for VAULT_KEY */}

For production environments, generate secure values for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `VAULT_KEY`:

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY_BASE
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate VAULT_KEY
openssl rand -base64 32
```
