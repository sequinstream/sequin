 ## Supported databases

Sequin works with any PostgreSQL database version 14 or higher that supports [Logical Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

You can find guides for connecting to local and hosted databases in the [connect postgres](/connect-postgres) guide.

## Database connection details

Sequin requires the following details to connect to your database:

- **Host**: The hostname of your database
- **Port**: The port number of your database
- **Database**: The name of your database
- **Username**: The username of a database user with the [necessary permissions](#database-user-permissions)
- **Password**: The password for the database user

You can also enable or disable SSL mode for your database connection.

### Tunneling to your database

Use the [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) to create a secure tunnel between Sequin Cloud and a database running on your local machine.

If your database is hosted by a cloud provider and requires a VPN to connect, Sequin can create a secure tunnel through a bastion host. Please [contact support](mailto:support@sequinstream.com) to enable this.

## Database user permissions

We recommend creating a dedicated database user for Sequin. Grant that user the following permissions:

- `connect` permission on the database.
- `select` permission on all the tables you want to connect to Sequin.
- `replication` permission (to read from replication slots).

You can create a user with those permissions with the following commands:

```sql
-- Create user with a secure password
create user sequin_user with password 'REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_PASSWORD';
-- Grant connect permission
grant connect on database your_database to sequin_user;
-- Grant select permission on tables you want to replicate
grant select on table table1, table2, table3 to sequin_user;
-- OR grant select on all tables in a schema
grant select on all tables in schema public to sequin_user;
-- Grant replication permission
alter user sequin_user with replication;
```

Please create a strong password for Sequin's database user. You can generate a secure password using the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 24
```

## Enabling logical replication

Sequin requires logical replication to be enabled on your database. You can check if it's enabled:

```sql
show wal_level;
```

If the value isn't `logical`, you'll need to enable it. The process for enabling logical replication varies by provider. You can find more information in the following guides:

- [Standard PostgreSQL](/connect-postgres): Modify `postgresql.conf` to set `wal_level = logical`
- [AWS RDS](/how-to/setup-rds): Create a parameter group with `rds.logical_replication = 1`
- [Google Cloud SQL](/how-to/setup-gcp): Enable through the console or API
- [Azure](/how-to/setup-azure): Configure through server parameters
- [Neon](/how-to/setup-neon): Enable through project settings
- [Supabase](/how-to/setup-supabase): Enabled by default

<Warning>
Enabling logical replication often requires a database restart.
</Warning>

## Publications

[Publications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html) identify which tables to track for changes.

<Warning>
Create the [publication](#publications) **before** creating the replication slot. If you don't, the publication and slot combination may be invalid, and Sequin will fail to connect to your database.
</Warning>

### Creating a publication

The simplest publication includes all tables:

```sql
create publication sequin_publication for all tables;
```

To specify a subset of tables, use the following command:

```sql
create publication sequin_publication for table table1, table2, table3;
```

Or all tables in a schema:

```sql
create publication sequin_publication for all tables in schema public;
```

### Working with partitioned tables

When using partitioned tables, you **must ensure [`publish_via_partition_root`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html#SQL-CREATEPUBLICATION-PARAMS-WITH-PUBLISH-VIA-PARTITION-ROOT) is set to `true`** to ensure Sequin captures changes correctly. This means changes to partition tables are associated with the root table:

```sql
-- Create publication for a partitioned table
create publication sequin_publication for table orders 
with (publish_via_partition_root = true);

-- Or modify an existing publication
alter publication sequin_publication set (publish_via_partition_root = true);
```

<Note>
You can check this setting by running, for example:

```sql
SELECT pubviaroot FROM pg_publication where pubname = 'sequin_pub';
```

</Note>

### Modifying Publications

To add or remove tables from a publication, use the `ALTER PUBLICATION` statement:

```sql
-- Drop all tables
alter publication sequin_publication drop all tables;
-- Add tables
alter publication sequin_publication add table table1, table2, table3;
-- Drop tables
alter publication sequin_publication drop table table1, table2, table3;
-- Add all tables in a schema
alter publication sequin_publication add all tables in schema my_schema;
-- Drop all tables in a schema
alter publication sequin_publication drop all tables in schema my_schema;
```

### Deleting a Publication

You can delete a publication using the `DROP PUBLICATION` statement:

```sql
drop publication sequin_publication;
```

## Replication slots

[Replication slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/catalog-pg-replication-slots.html) ensure that PostgreSQL retains WAL (Write-Ahead Log) data needed by Sequin.

### Creating a Replication Slot

```sql
create replication slot sequin_slot;
```

### Deleting a Replication Slot

```sql
drop replication slot sequin_slot;
```

### Best practices

<Warning>
Create the [publication](#publications) **before** creating the replication slot. If you don't, the publication and slot combination may be invalid, and Sequin will fail to connect to your database.
</Warning>

**Monitor slot lag**
    Excessive lag in a replication slot can cause WAL buildup and disk space issues. Monitor lag with:

    ```sql
    select * from pg_replication_slots;
    ```

**Clean up unused slots**: Delete slots that are no longer in use to prevent WAL retention:

```sql
select pg_drop_replication_slot('sequin_slot');
```

## Replica identity

Sequin uses `REPLICA IDENTITY` for two purposes:

1. To determine the old values of an updated row. These values are used to create the `changes` field for [change messages](/reference/messages#change-messages).
2. To load unchanged TOAST columns for updates of both [change](/reference/messages#change-messages) and [row](/reference/messages#row-messages) sink consumers.

### Changes

With `REPLICA IDENTITY` set to `FULL`, Sequin receives new and old values for all columns during updates. For columns that have changed values, Sequin includes the old values in the `changes` field.

### TOAST columns

PostgreSQL uses TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) to store large column values. Here's how Sequin handles TOAST columns:

- TOAST columns are always included for INSERT operations
- For UPDATE operations:
  - Changed TOAST columns are included in rows and changes
  - Unchanged TOAST columns will appear as `"unchanged_toast"` unless `REPLICA IDENTITY` is set to `FULL`
  - If `REPLICA IDENTITY` is `FULL`, all TOAST columns are included regardless of changes
- For DELETE operations:
  - TOAST columns are included only if `REPLICA IDENTITY` is set to `FULL`

This behavior applies to both changes and rows in Sequin.

To set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` for a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

## Monitoring

Sequin will run health checks against your database connection automatically. You can view the status of the connection at any time in your database's "Overview" page.
