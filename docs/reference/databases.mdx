 ## Supported databases

Sequin works with any PostgreSQL database version 12 or higher that supports [Logical Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

You can find guides for connecting to local and hosted databases in the [connect postgres](/connect-postgres) guide.

## Database connection details

Sequin requires the following details to connect to your database:

- **Host**: The hostname of your database
- **Port**: The port number of your database
- **Database**: The name of your database
- **Username**: The username of a database user with the [necessary permissions](#database-user-permissions)
- **Password**: The password for the database user

You can also enable or disable SSL mode for your database connection.

### Tunneling to your database

Use the [Sequin CLI](/reference/cli/overview) to create a secure tunnel between Sequin Cloud and a database running on your local machine.

If your database is hosted by a cloud provider and requires a VPN to connect, Sequin can create a secure tunnel through a bastion host. Please [contact support](mailto:support@sequinstream.com) to enable this.

## Database user permissions

We recommend creating a dedicated database user for Sequin. Grant that user the following permissions:

- `connect` permission on the database.
- `select` permission on all the tables you want to connect to Sequin.
- `replication` permission (to read from replication slots).

You can create a user with those permissions with the following commands:

```sql
-- Create user with a secure password
create user sequin_user with password 'REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_PASSWORD';
-- Grant connect permission
grant connect on database your_database to sequin_user;
-- Grant select permission on tables you want to replicate
grant select on table table1, table2, table3 to sequin_user;
-- OR grant select on all tables in a schema
grant select on all tables in schema public to sequin_user;
-- Grant replication permission
alter user sequin_user with replication;
```

Please create a strong password for Sequin's database user. You can generate a secure password using the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 24
```

## Enabling logical replication

Sequin requires logical replication to be enabled on your database. You can check if it's enabled:

```sql
show wal_level;
```

If the value isn't `logical`, you'll need to enable it. The process for enabling logical replication varies by provider. You can find more information in the following guides:

- [Standard PostgreSQL](/connect-postgres): Modify `postgresql.conf` to set `wal_level = logical`
- [AWS RDS](/how-to/setup-rds): Create a parameter group with `rds.logical_replication = 1`
- [Google Cloud SQL](/how-to/setup-gcp): Enable through the console or API
- [Azure](/how-to/setup-azure): Configure through server parameters
- [Neon](/how-to/setup-neon): Enable through project settings
- [Supabase](/how-to/setup-supabase): Enabled by default

<Warning>
Enabling logical replication often requires a database restart.
</Warning>

## Publications

[Publications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html) identify which tables to track for changes.

By default, Sequin looks for a publication named `sequin_publication`.

### Creating a publication

The simplest publication includes all tables:

```sql
create publication sequin_publication for all tables;
```

To specify a subset of tables, use the following command:

```sql
create publication sequin_publication for table table1, table2, table3;
```

Or all tables in a schema:

```sql
create publication sequin_publication for all tables in schema public;
```

### Modifying Publications

To add or remove tables from a publication, use the `ALTER PUBLICATION` statement:

```sql
-- Drop all tables
alter publication sequin_publication drop all tables;
-- Add tables
alter publication sequin_publication add table table1, table2, table3;
-- Drop tables
alter publication sequin_publication drop table table1, table2, table3;
-- Add all tables in a schema
alter publication sequin_publication add all tables in schema my_schema;
-- Drop all tables in a schema
alter publication sequin_publication drop all tables in schema my_schema;
```

### Deleting a Publication

You can delete a publication using the `DROP PUBLICATION` statement:

```sql
drop publication sequin_publication;
```

## Replication slots

[Replication slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/catalog-pg-replication-slots.html) ensure that PostgreSQL retains WAL (Write-Ahead Log) data needed by Sequin.

By default, Sequin looks for a slot named `sequin_slot`.

### Creating a Replication Slot

```sql
create replication slot sequin_slot;
```

### Deleting a Replication Slot

```sql
drop replication slot sequin_slot;
```

### Best practices

**Monitor slot lag**
    Excessive lag in a replication slot can cause WAL buildup and disk space issues. Monitor lag with:

    ```sql
    select * from pg_replication_slots;
    ```

**Use meaningful names**: Name slots clearly to identify their purpose, e.g., `sequin_prod_slot`, `sequin_audit_slot`

**Clean up unused slots**: Delete slots that are no longer in use to prevent WAL retention:

```sql
select pg_drop_replication_slot('sequin_slot');
```
## Monitoring

Sequin will run health checks against your database connection automatically. You can view the status of the connection at any time in your database's "Overview" page.
