description: Reference for Sequin's enrichment functionality. Use enrichment to add additional data to your messages before they are sent to sinks.
---

Enrichment allows you to enrich your messages with additional data from your database before they are sent to the sink destination. This is useful for:

- Adding related data from other tables to your messages
- Reducing the number of queries your downstream systems need to make
- Including near commit-time data to your messages

## How it works

When you configure enrichment on a sink consumer, Sequin will:

1. Batch messages that need to be enriched
2. Execute your enrichment query with the primary keys of those messages
3. Merge the enrichment results back into the original messages
4. Send the enriched messages through the rest of your sink pipeline, including into transform and routing functions

## Enrichment syntax

Enrichment functions must:

1. Use parameterized queries with `$1` syntax
2. Select all primary key columns from the source table
3. Select additional fields for enrichment
4. Return 0 or 1 row per message

Here's an example that enriches user messages with their account name:

```sql
SELECT
  u.id, -- you must select all primary keys of the source table for Sequin to associate the enrichment with the message
  a.name as account_name -- example of an enrichment field
FROM
  users u -- this enrichment is triggered on `users` table change messages
JOIN
  accounts a on u.account_id = a.id
WHERE
  -- the `ANY syntax is required for Sequin to perform batched queries
  u.id = ANY($1)
```

### Primary keys

Your enrichment query must select all primary key columns from the source table. These are used to match the enrichment results back to the original messages.

For example, if your table has a primary key of `id`, your query must select `id`:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  -- enrichment fields
  account_name,
  subscription_status
FROM users u
JOIN accounts a ON u.account_id = a.id
WHERE id = ANY($1)
```

### Parameterization

Enrichment functions must use the `$1` syntax for parameterization. This allows Sequin to safely batch multiple messages into a single query.

#### Composite primary keys

If your table has componsite primary keys, you must use a relatively advanced SQL where clause to select rows with those keys. Consider a table with a primary keys of `(id, account_id)`:

```sql highlight={8-12}
SELECT
  id,
  account_name,
  subscription_status
FROM users u
JOIN accounts a ON u.account_id = a.id

-- WHERE clause for composite primary keys
WHERE (u.account_id, u.id) = ANY(
  SELECT (r.account_id, r.id) 
  FROM unnest($1, $2) AS r(account_id, id)
);
```

Sequin will assign the primary key values to two parameters, `$1` and `$2`. Sequin will assign them in alphabetical order of the column names. In this case, Sequin will assign `$1` to a list of all account IDs and `$2` to a list of all user IDs for the batched messages.

### Results

Your query should return either 0 or 1 row for each message. If your query returns multiple rows for a message, Sequin will raise an error.

The enrichment results will be merged into the original message's record. Any fields returned by your query will overwrite fields with the same name in the original record.

## Testing enrichment

When creating or editing an enrichment function, Sequin will automatically capture up to 10 recent events from your database. You can see how your enrichment affects these events in real-time.

When changes occur in a connected database and you have the enrichment editor open, Sequin will capture events and display them in the editor.

## Example use cases

### Adding related data

Enrich messages with data from related tables:

```sql
SELECT
  orders.id,
  customers.name as customer_name,
  customers.email as customer_email
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE orders.id = ANY($1)
```

### Calculating aggregates

Add computed fields to your messages:

```sql
SELECT
  users.id,
  COUNT(orders.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(orders.amount) as lifetime_value
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id
WHERE users.id = ANY($1)
GROUP BY users.id
```

### Formatting data

Transform data into a more useful format:

```sql
SELECT
  users.id,
  CONCAT(users.first_name, ' ', users.last_name) as full_name,
  LOWER(users.email) as email_normalized
FROM users
WHERE users.id = ANY($1)
```
