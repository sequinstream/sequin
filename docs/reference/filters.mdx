When setting up a sink, you can optionally specify one or more **filters** to apply to the table:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxWidth: '600px'}} src="/images/reference/filter-component.png" alt="Filter component" />
</Frame>

Only changes and rows that match the filters will be sent to the sink.

## Operations to capture

When configuring a sink, you can specify which Postgres operations to capture:

- `insert`
- `update`
- `delete`

<Note>
  If you backfill a table to a sink, Sequin will send `read` messages for each row in the table, regardless of which operations you specify.
</Note>

## Filter functions

Filter functions provide more advanced filtering capabilities than what's possible with column filters alone. They allow you to:

- Apply complex conditional logic to your data
- Compare new and old values for changed rows
- Use string pattern matching or regular expressions
- Implement custom business logic for filtering

Filter functions are written in Elixir and must return a boolean value (`true` or `false`). Filter functions that return non-boolean values will fail to execute.

### How filter functions work

When you create a filter function, you define an Elixir function that evaluates whether a message should be processed. For each message, your filter function receives:

```elixir
def filter(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  # Your filtering logic here
  # Must return true or false
end
```

Parameters:
- `action`: The operation type (e.g., "insert", "update", "delete")
- `record`: The full row/record data as a map with string keys
- `changes`: For update operations, contains the old values that were changed
- `metadata`: Additional information like table name, timestamp, etc.

### How filters are combined

When you set up a sink with multiple types of filters, all filters are applied with a logical AND. This means the operation must match one of the selected operations (insert, update, delete) and the filter function (if specified) must return `true`.

If any of these conditions fail, the message will not be delivered to the sink.

### Example filter functions

#### Filter by string pattern

```elixir
def filter(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  # Only process records where name starts with "A"
  String.starts_with?(record["name"], "A")
end
```

#### Filter by multiple conditions

```elixir
def filter(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  # Only process VIP customers with high-value orders
  record["customer_type"] == "VIP" and record["is_deleted"] == false
end
```

#### Complex filtering with metadata

```elixir
def filter(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  # Filter based on both record content and metadata
  is_high_priority = record["priority"] == "high"
  is_users_table = metadata.table_name == "users"

  # Only process high priority records from the users table
  is_high_priority and is_users_table
end
```

#### Filtering based on changes

```elixir
def filter(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  # Only process updates where the status changed from "pending" to "approved"
  action == "update" and
    changes["status"] == "pending" and
    record["status"] == "approved"
end
```

### Testing filter functions

When creating or editing a filter function, Sequin will automatically capture recent events from your database so you can test your function with real data. You'll see a live preview showing which messages would pass or fail your filter.
