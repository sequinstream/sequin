---

## Overview

The Sequin Management API allows you to programmatically control Sequin resources like sinks, HTTP endpoints, and backfills. This API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for request and response bodies.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token. The token can be found in the Sequin Console under the "Manage account" section.

Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

An example cURL request with Bearer token authorization:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sequinstream.com/api/sinks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Base URL

In cloud, the base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://api.sequinstream.com/api
```

In our dev docker compose setup, the base URL is:

```
http://localhost:7376/api
```

In self hosted deploys, you can access the API on the same port as the console. The URL will be something like:

```
http(s)://your-host:your-port/api
```

For the rest of this document, we provide paths to be concatenated onto the base URL. For instance, the path to list sinks is:

```
GET /sinks
```

And the fully qualified URL is:

```
https://api.sequinstream.com/api/sinks
```

or

```
http://localhost:7376/api/sinks
```

## Endpoints
### Sinks

[Sinks](/reference/sinks/overview) stream data from a table to a destination. The following endpoints are available for managing sinks:

#### List sinks

```http
GET /sinks
```

Returns a list of all sinks.

Example cURL request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sequinstream.com/api/sinks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

With response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "4ed2a8e5-47a7-4b51-9270-d2f4fdcb94fb",

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

- 200: Success
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 422: Unprocessable Entity
- 500: Internal Server Error

Error responses include a JSON body with details about the error:

```json
HTTP 422
{
    "summary": "Validation failed",
    "validation_errors": {
        "status": [
            "is invalid"
        ]
    }
}
```
