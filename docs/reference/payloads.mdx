Sequin converts Postgres changes into JSON payloads that are delivered to your sinks. Each payload contains the current record, any previous values, the action that occurred, and metadata about the event. Unless you apply a [transform](/reference/transforms), this is the shape most sinks receive.

```js
{
  record: {
    [key: string]: any;  // The row data
  };
  changes: null | {
    [key: string]: any;  // Previous values for changed fields (updates only)
  };
  action: "insert" | "update" | "delete" | "read";
  metadata: {
    table_schema: string;
    table_name: string;
    commit_timestamp: string;  // ISO timestamp
    commit_lsn: integer;  // Logical replication LSN of the transaction
    commit_idx: integer;  // The index of the message within the transaction
    idempotency_key: string; // Opaque token
    transaction_annotations: null | {
      [key: string]: any;  // User-provided transaction context
    };
    sink: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
    };
  };
}
```

For update operations, `record` contains the new values and `changes` contains the previous values of only the fields that changed. For all other operations, `changes` is null.

### Idempotency

The `metadata` of each message includes an `idempotency_key` which your application can use to reject any [possible duplicate messages](/reference/sinks/overview#guaranteed-delivery).

For regular changes (non-backfill), the idempotency key is based on the transaction's position in the database log and its position within that transaction.

For backfill messages, the key is based on the backfill's unique identifier and the primary key values of the record being processed.
