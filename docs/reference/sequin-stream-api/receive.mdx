sidebarTitle: "Receive"
description: "Use the `/receive` endpoint to get one or more messages from a Sequin Stream"
api: 'POST /api/http_pull_consumers/{consumer_name_or_id}/receive'
---

<Note>You can use either `POST` or `GET` to receive messages from a Sequin Stream.</Note>

## Request parameters

<ParamField path="name_or_id" type="string" required>
  The ID or name of the Sequin Stream.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="batch_size" type="integer" placeholder={1}>
  Number of messages to try to fetch from the stream. Defaults to `1`.

  The count of returned messages may be less than the requested batch size if there are fewer messages available for the consumer.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="wait_for" type="integer | string" placeholder={0}>
  Amount of time to wait for messages to become available in the stream, in milliseconds. Defaults to `0`.

  When `wait_for` is greater than `0`, the request will block until any messages are available or `wait_for` milliseconds have passed.

  Therefore, you can use `wait_for` to implement long polling.

  Instead of passing in an integer, you can also pass in a duration string, like `"60s"`, `"5000ms"`, or `"5m"`.
</ParamField>

## Response fields

The response is an object with a `data` property that contains a list of messages. Within each message is an `ack_id` and a `data` property that contains the message data.

<ResponseField name="data" type="list">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="record" type="Record">
    A [message](/reference/messages) containing the message data with a key for each column in the associated table.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="ack_id" type="string">
    You'll use the `ack_id` in follow-up requests to either [ack](/reference/sequin-stream-api/ack) or [nack](/reference/sequin-stream-api/nack) this specific message.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
