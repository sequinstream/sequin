The GCP Pub/Sub sink sends messages to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

<Tip>
  This is the reference for the GCP Pub/Sub sink. See the [quickstart](/quickstart/gcp-pubsub) for a step-by-step walkthrough or the [how-to guide](/how-to/stream-postgres-to-gcp-pubsub) for an explanation of how to use the GCP Pub/Sub sink.
</Tip>

## Configuration

- **Project ID**

    Your Google Cloud project ID (e.g., `my-project-123`).

- **Topic ID**

    The ID of your Pub/Sub topic (e.g., `postgres-changes`).

- **Service Account Credentials** (when not using Application Default Credentials)

    The JSON key file contents for a service account with permissions to publish to the specified topic.

- **Use Application Default Credentials** (optional)

    When enabled (`true`), Sequin will automatically discover GCP credentials from the environment instead of requiring explicit service account keys. This is recommended for deployments on GCP compute environments where service accounts can be attached directly to the compute instance.

    When this option is enabled, you do not need to provide service account credentials.

## Service account permissions

Sequin requires a service account with the following roles:

- `roles/pubsub.publisher`: Allows publishing messages to topics
- `roles/pubsub.viewer`: Allows viewing topic configuration and metadata

### Using service account keys (explicit credentials)

For explicit service account credentials, create a service account and download the JSON key file. For more information on creating a service account, see the [how-to guide](/how-to/stream-postgres-to-gcp-pubsub#create-a-service-account).

### Using Application Default Credentials (recommended for GCP environments)

When deploying Sequin on GCP infrastructure, you can attach the service account directly to the compute instance:

- **Compute Engine**: Attach the service account to the VM instance
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Use Workload Identity to associate the service account with the Kubernetes service account
- **Cloud Run**: Attach the service account to the Cloud Run service
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Attach the service account to the function

Then set `use_application_default_credentials: true` in your sink configuration. Sequin will automatically discover and use the credentials from the environment.

## Configuration examples

### Using service account keys

```yaml
sinks:
  - name: "gcp-pubsub-sink"
    batch_size: 10
    destination:
      type: "gcp_pubsub"
      project_id: "my-project"
      topic_id: "postgres-changes"
      credentials: |
        {
          "type": "service_account",
          "project_id": "my-project",
          "private_key_id": "key-id",
          "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
          "client_email": "sequin@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
          "client_id": "123456789",
          "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
          "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
          "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
          "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/sequin%40my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
        }
```

### Using Application Default Credentials (recommended for GCP environments)

```yaml
sinks:
  - name: "gcp-pubsub-sink"
    batch_size: 10
    destination:
      type: "gcp_pubsub"
      project_id: "my-project"
      topic_id: "postgres-changes"
      use_application_default_credentials: true
```

<Note>
When using `use_application_default_credentials: true`, ensure your compute instance has the required service account attached with the necessary Pub/Sub permissions.
</Note>

## Message format

Sequin sends messages to Pub/Sub as JSON. The base message format follows the [messages reference](/reference/messages), with additional Pub/Sub specific attributes.

### Message Structure

Each message published to Pub/Sub contains:

1. **Data** - The main message payload follows the [messages reference](/reference/messages) structure. The data is encoded as JSON then base64 encoded.

2. **Attributes** - Message attributes that can be used for filtering and routing:
   - `trace_id` - A unique identifier for tracing the message through the system
   - `type` - Always "event"
   - `table_name` - The name of the source table
   - `action` - The type of change: "insert", "update", "delete", or "read"

3. **Ordering Key** - Used for message ordering when enabled on the subscription. The key is generated based on:
   - By default, the primary key(s) of the source row
   - If custom grouping is configured, the specified grouping column values

## Retry behavior

If Sequin is unable to deliver a message to Pub/Sub, it will retry the message indefinitely. Sequin will exponentially back off the retry interval, with a maximum backoff of roughly 3 minutes.

## Message size limits

Pub/Sub has a [maximum message size of 10MB](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas#resource_limits). If Pub/Sub rejects a message due to size limitations, Sequin will cancel the message's delivery.

## Grouping and ordering

When you create a subscription in Pub/Sub, you can enable "[message ordering](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering)" on the subscription. When enabled, messages in Pub/Sub tagged with the same ordering key will be received in the order they are published.

When you configure a Pub/Sub sink in Sequin, you can specify message grouping behavior. This will be used to set the `ordering_key` on the messages published to Pub/Sub.

The default message group for a message is the source row's primary key(s). You can override this by specifying one or more columns to use for message grouping.

Sequin will order the delivery of messages with the same group according to their commit timestamp.

## Throughput and batching

By default, Sequin publishes messages to Pub/Sub one at a time (`batch_size=1`). This is because the default ordering key is set to the primary key(s) of the source row, and Pub/Sub does not allow batching messages with different ordering keys.

If you don't need message ordering in Pub/Sub, you can significantly improve throughput by:

1. **Disabling message grouping** - Set `message_grouping: false` at the sink level
2. **Increasing batch size** - Set `batch_size` to a higher value (e.g., 100-1000)

Here's an example configuration for high throughput:

```yaml
sinks:
  - name: my_pubsub_sink
    message_grouping: false  # Disables message grouping and ordering key
    batch_size: 300
    tables:
      - name: public.my_table
        # group_column_names not allowed when message_grouping is false
```

When `message_grouping` is disabled, Sequin will not set an `ordering_key` on the published messages, allowing Pub/Sub to process them in parallel for maximum throughput.

<Note>
  Editing message grouping settings in the Sequin web console is coming soon (July 2025). For now, you can configure message grouping using YAML configuration or the Sequin API.
</Note>

## Debugging

You can view the status of your Pub/Sub sink in the Sequin web console.

On the "Messages" tab, you can see which messages are in-flight to Pub/Sub, which messages Sequin is unable to deliver, and recently delivered messages.

Messages that Sequin is unable to deliver will have a "Deliver count" greater than `1`. You can click on a message to see more details, including the last error response received from Pub/Sub.

Common issues to check when debugging:
- Service account credentials are valid and not expired
- Service account has the required Pub/Sub roles
- Project ID and Topic ID match exactly
- Topic exists in the specified project

## Local development with the emulator

Sequin supports using the [GCP Pub/Sub emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator) for local development. The emulator provides a local Pub/Sub environment that mimics the behavior of the real service.

To use the emulator, first consult GCP's [installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator).

With the emulator installed, you can start it like this:

```bash
gcloud beta emulators pubsub start --project=my-project
```

You can create new topics using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     http://localhost:8085/v1/projects/my-project/topics/my-topic
```

When setting up the sink in the Sequin console, toggle on "Use emulator" to use the emulator. For the host, use the fully-qualified URL of the emulator, e.g. `http://localhost:8085`.

## Routing

The GCP PubSub sink supports dynamic routing of the `topic_id` with [routing functions](/reference/routing).

Example routing function:

```elixir
def route(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  %{
    topic_id: "#{metadata.database_name}-#{metadata.table_schema}-#{metadata.table_name}"
  }
end
```

When not using a routing function, messages will be published to the topic specified in the sink configuration.
