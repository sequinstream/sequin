A **sink** in Sequin is a destination for your Postgres data.

## Common sink behaviors

### Guaranteed delivery

Sequin guarantees delivery of messages to sinks. If a message is not delivered successfully, Sequin will retry. Sequin will expontentially backoff the retry interval, up to a maximum of roughly 3 minutes.

### Message grouping and ordering

Sequin has the ability to group messages by one or more fields. By default, Sequin groups messages by the primary key value(s) of the source row.

You can specify message grouping behavior when configuring a sink.

How message grouping and ordering work depends on the type of sink you're using. See the reference page for your sink for details.

### Backfill support

Sequin supports backfilling to sinks. See the [backfills reference](/reference/backfills) for more details.

## Monitoring and debugging

You can view the status of sinks in the Sequin web console.

All sinks have a "Messages" tab that shows the status of messages currently in flight to the sink, recently delivered messages, and messages that have failed delivery.

You can click into any failed message to view the delivery logs and error details.
