The S2 sink delivers database change events to an [S2](https://s2.dev/) stream.

S2 ("Stream Store") is a cloud-native storage layer purpose-built for data in motion. Streams are unlimited, durable, and serverless – you pay only for the data you append and read.

## Configuration

When you create an S2 sink you'll provide three fields:

- **Basin**

    The S2 basin that owns your stream. A basin is similar to an S3 bucket – it namespaces one or more streams.

- **Stream**

    The name of the stream inside the basin (e.g. `products`).

- **Access Token**

    An S2 access token with *append* permissions for the target stream. Generate tokens in the S2 web console under **Access Tokens**.

<Info>
  The Sequin S2 sink uses the access token provided to make HTTPS requests to the S2 REST API.

## Message format

Sequin sends **JSON** [messages](/reference/messages) and is encoded as UTF-8 text.

You can customize the payload with [transform functions](/reference/transforms).

## Retry behavior

If S2 rejects a write (for example due to throttling or network errors) Sequin:

1. Immediately re-queues the message at the front of the delivery queue.
2. Retries with exponential back-off
3. Continues indefinitely until the message is acknowledged by S2 or you "Acknowledge" the message from the **Messages** tab.

## Record size limits

S2 currently supports records up to **1 MiB** (the maximum size of a single append request). If a message exceeds this limit S2 returns `payload too large` and Sequin will keep retrying. The typical fix is to:

1. Identify the offending column(s).
2. Create a transform that removes or compresses those fields.
3. Retry the failed message or "Acknowledge" it as undeliverable.

## Grouping & ordering

The S2 sink preserves the *commit-timestamp order* of messages that share the same **group**. By default the group is the primary key of the source row, ensuring changes to a single row arrive in order.

You can override grouping in the sink UI by specifying one or more columns (for example `user_id`). Messages with different group values may be interleaved, but messages with the same group value are delivered sequentially.

## Debugging

Use the Sequin console to monitor delivery:

1. Open the sink and switch to the **Messages** tab.
2. Filter by *Failed* to see messages Sequin could not deliver.
3. Click a message to inspect the last S2 error response and stack trace.

Common issues include:

- Invalid or expired access token (S2 returns **401 Unauthorized**).
- Basin / stream name typo (S2 returns **404 Not Found**).
- Record size > 1 MiB (**413 Payload Too Large**).

For live verification you can tail the stream with the S2 CLI:

```bash
s2 tail s2://<basin>/<stream>
```
Successful reads confirm that S2 is receiving and storing events.
