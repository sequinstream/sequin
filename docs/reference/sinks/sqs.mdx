The SQS sink sends messages to an Amazon SQS queue.

## Configuration

- **Queue URL**

    The URL of your Amazon SQS queue. Must be in the format: `https://sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account-id>/<queue-name>`.

    For FIFO queues, the queue name must end with `.fifo`.

- **Access Key ID**

    The AWS access key ID with permissions to send messages to the specified SQS queue.

- **Secret Access Key**

    The AWS secret access key corresponding to the access key ID.

## IAM user permissions

Sequin requires an IAM user with the following permissions:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "sqs:SendMessage",
          "sqs:SendMessageBatch",
          "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
          "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
          "sqs:ListQueues",
          "sqs:ListQueueTags",
          "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility"
        ],
        "Resource": "<your-queue-arn>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

Replace `<your-queue-arn>` with your actual queue ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-queue`).

## Message format

Sequin sends messages to SQS as JSON. You can find the shape of the messages in the [messages reference](/reference/messages).

## Retry behavior

If Sequin is unable to deliver a message to SQS, it will retry the message indefinitely. Sequin will exponentially back off the retry interval, with a maximum backoff of roughly 3 minutes.

## Max message size

SQS allows for a [max message size of 256 KB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html#:~:text=The%20minimum%20message%20size%20is,Extended%20Client%20Library%20for%20Python%20.).

If SQS rejects a message, Sequin will cancel the message's delivery.

## Grouping and ordering

You can control message grouping behavior using the `message_grouping` configuration option:

- `message_grouping: true` (default): Enable message grouping for ordered delivery
- `message_grouping: false`: Disable message grouping for maximum throughput

When `message_grouping` is enabled, Sequin will set the `MessageGroupId` on SQS messages if you're using a FIFO queue. The default message group for a message is the source row's primary key(s). You can override this by specifying one or more columns to use for message grouping at the table level.

When `message_grouping` is disabled, no `MessageGroupId` is set, allowing for higher throughput but without ordering guarantees.

Sequin will order the delivery of messages with the same group according to their commit timestamp.

```yaml
sinks:
  - name: "sqs-ordered"
    message_grouping: true  # Enable grouping
    batch_size: 10
    tables:
      - name: "public.orders"
        group_column_names: ["customer_id"]  # Group by customer instead of PK
    destination:
      type: "sqs"
      queue_url: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/orders.fifo"

  - name: "sqs-high-throughput"
    message_grouping: false  # Disable grouping for max throughput
    batch_size: 10
    destination:
      type: "sqs"
      queue_url: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/events"
```

### FIFO vs standard queues

FIFO queues are generally recommended. They ensure that messages pertaining to the same row are processed in order.

## Routing

The AWS SQS sink supports dynamic routing of the `queue_url` with [routing functions](/reference/routing).

Example routing function:

```elixir
def route(action, record, changes, metadata) do
  %{
    queue_url: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/#{metadata.table_name}"
  }
end
```

When not using a routing function, messages will be published to the queue specified in the sink configuration.

## Debugging

You can view the status of your SQS sink in the Sequin web console.

On the "Messages" tab, you can see which messages are in-flight to SQS, which messages Sequin is unable to deliver, and recently delivered messages.

Messages that Sequin is unable to deliver will have a "Deliver count" greater than `1`. You can click on a message to see more details, including the last error response received from SQS.
