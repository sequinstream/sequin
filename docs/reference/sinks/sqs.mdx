The SQS sink sends messages to an Amazon SQS queue.

## Configuration

- **Queue URL**

    The URL of your Amazon SQS queue. Must be in the format: `https://sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account-id>/<queue-name>`.
    
    For FIFO queues, the queue name must end with `.fifo`.

- **Access Key ID**

    The AWS access key ID with permissions to send messages to the specified SQS queue.

- **Secret Access Key**

    The AWS secret access key corresponding to the access key ID.

## IAM user permissions

Sequin requires an IAM user with the following permissions:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "sqs:SendMessage",
          "sqs:SendMessageBatch",
          "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
          "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
          "sqs:ListQueues",
          "sqs:ListQueueTags",
          "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility"
        ],
        "Resource": "<your-queue-arn>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

Replace `<your-queue-arn>` with your actual queue ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-queue`).

## Message format

Sequin sends messages to SQS as JSON. You can find the shape of the messages in the [messages reference](/reference/payloads).

## Retry behavior

If Sequin is unable to deliver a message to SQS, it will retry the message indefinitely. Sequin will exponentially back off the retry interval, with a maximum backoff of roughly 3 minutes.

## Max message size

SQS allows for a [max message size of 256 KB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html#:~:text=The%20minimum%20message%20size%20is,Extended%20Client%20Library%20for%20Python%20.).

If SQS rejects a message, Sequin will cancel the message's delivery.

## Grouping and ordering

When you configure an SQS sink, you can specify message grouping behavior. This will be used to set the `MessageGroupId` on the SQS message if you're using a FIFO queue.

The default message group for a message is the source row's primary key(s). You can override this by specifying one or more columns to use for message grouping.

Sequin will order the delivery of messages with the same group according to their commit timestamp.

### FIFO vs standard queues

FIFO queues are generally recommended. They ensure that messages pertaining to the same row are processed in order. 

## Debugging

You can view the status of your SQS sink in the Sequin web console.

On the "Messages" tab, you can see which messages are in-flight to SQS, which messages Sequin is unable to deliver, and recently delivered messages.

Messages that Sequin is unable to deliver will have a "Deliver count" greater than `1`. You can click on a message to see more details, including the last error response received from SQS.
