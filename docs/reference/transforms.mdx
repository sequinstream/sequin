description: Reference for Sequin's transforms. Use transforms to modify the structure of your messages before they are sent to sinks.

import FunctionTransformSnippet from '/snippets/function-transform-snippet.mdx';

Transforms allow you to modify the structure of your messages before they are sent to the sink destination. This is useful for:

- Simplifying message payloads to reduce bandwidth and storage costs
- Converting from the database's format to a format compatible with your sink destination or downstream systems
- Maintaining the same message format as you migrate from e.g. Debezium to Sequin
- Keeping payloads under size limits (e.g., SQS' 256KB limit)


## Path transform

Path transforms are the simplest kind of transform. Path transforms allow you to extract one field from your message using a dot-notation path. This is useful for:

1. Sending just the latest record to the destination (e.g., for materialized views in Postgres or data warehouses)
2. Extracting just the record ID to keep payloads small (e.g., for SQS with its 256KB limit)

### Path syntax

The first part of the path is always one of the four [keys of the message object](/reference/payloads): `record`, `changes`, `action`, or `metadata`.

You can optionally add additional keys to traverse the message structure. For example, `record.id` will extract the `id` field from the `record` object.

Some examples:

| Path | Description | Example Value |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `record` | The full record object | `{"id": 123, "address": {"city": "Anytown"}}` |
| `record.id` | A specific field from the record | `123` |
| `record.address.city` | A nested field from the record | `"Anytown"` |

Paths can be as deep as you need them to be. For example, `record.address.city` will extract the `city` field from the `address` JSONB column in the `record` object.

### Testing transforms

When creating or editing a transform, Sequin will automatically capture up to 10 recent events from your database. You can see how your transform affects these events in real-time.

When changes occur in a connected database and you have the transform editor open, Sequin will capture events and display them in the editor:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxWidth: '600px'}} src="/images/reference/record-only-transform.jpg" alt="Record only transform" />
</Frame>

This live preview helps ensure your transform will work correctly with your actual data.

### Example use cases

#### Keeping payloads small

When using SQS (which has a 256KB payload limit), you can use a path transform to extract just the record ID:

```yaml
transform:
  path: record.id
```

Your consumer can then query the full record details as needed.

#### Maintaining Debezium-like format

For systems expecting a Debezium-like format, use a path transform to extract just the record:

```yaml
transform:
  path: record
```

This ensures your messages match the expected format without additional metadata.
