You can start running Sequin quickly with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

You'll need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started with Sequin is with our [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml). This file starts a Postgres database, Redis instance, and Sequin server.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create directory and start services">
      1. Download [sequin-docker-compose.zip](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/releases/latest/download/sequin-docker-compose.zip).
      2. Unzip the file.
      3. Navigate to the unzipped directory and start the services:

      ```bash
      cd sequin-docker-compose && docker compose up -d
      ```

        <Accordion title="Alternative: Download with curl">
          ```bash
          curl -L https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/releases/latest/download/sequin-docker-compose.zip -o sequin-docker-compose.zip \
            && unzip sequin-docker-compose.zip && rm sequin-docker-compose.zip
          cd sequin-docker-compose && docker compose up -d
          ```
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Alternative: Clone the repository">
          ```bash
          git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
          cd sequin/docker
          docker compose up -d
          ```
        </Accordion>
      </AccordionGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify services are running">
      Check that Sequin is running using `docker ps`:

      ```bash
      docker ps
      ```

      You should see output like the following:

      ```
      CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
      abc123def456   sequinstream/sequin:latest           Up 10 seconds    0.0.0.0:7376->7376/tcp                     sequin
      def456ghi789   redis:7.0                            Up 10 seconds    0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp                     sequin-redis
      ghi789jkl012   postgres:15                          Up 10 seconds    0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp                     sequin-postgres
      ```

      <Check>
        All three containers should be up and running (status: `Up`).
      </Check>
    </Step>
  </Steps>

## Using your own database

### Using existing Postgres

Sequin uses a Postgres database for configuration and to assist with its change data capture process.

If you have an existing Postgres database you want Sequin to use for config, modify your `docker-compose.yaml`:

1. Remove the `postgres` service section
2. Update the Sequin service configuration:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      - PG_DATABASE=<database>
      - PG_USERNAME=<username>
      - PG_PASSWORD=<password>
```

### Using existing Redis

Sequin uses Redis to assist with its change data capture process.

If you have an existing Redis instance:

1. Remove the `redis` service section
2. Update the Sequin service configuration:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=<url>
```

## Adding to an existing project

To add Sequin to an existing project's Docker Compose file, add a `sequin` service:

```yaml
services:
  ...
  sequin:
    image: sequin/sequin:latest
    ports:
      - "7376:7376"
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=postgres
      - PG_DATABASE=sequin
      - PG_USERNAME=postgres
      - PG_PASSWORD=postgres
      - REDIS_URL=<url>
      - SECRET_KEY_BASE=wDPLYus0pvD6qJhKJICO4dauYPXfO/Yl782Zjtpew5qRBDp7CZvbWtQmY0eB13If
      - VAULT_KEY=2Sig69bIpuSm2kv0VQfDekET2qy8qUZGI8v3/h3ASiY=
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
```
