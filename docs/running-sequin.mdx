You can start running Sequin quickly with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

You'll need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Quick start

1. Create a directory for Sequin and download the Docker Compose file:
```bash
mkdir sequin && cd sequin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequinstream/sequin/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

Alternatively, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
cd sequin/docker
docker compose up -d
```

<Check>
  That's it! Sequin is now running locally with default configurations.
</Check>

## Using your own database

### Using existing Postgres

Sequin uses a Postgres database for configuration and to assist with its change data capture process.

If you have an existing Postgres database you want Sequin to use for config, modify your `docker-compose.yaml`:

1. Remove the `postgres` service section
2. Update the Sequin service configuration:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      - PG_DATABASE=<database>
      - PG_USERNAME=<username>
      - PG_PASSWORD=<password>
```

### Using existing Redis

Sequin uses Redis to assist with its change data capture process.

If you have an existing Redis instance:

1. Remove the `redis` service section
2. Update the Sequin service configuration:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=<url>
```

## Adding to an existing project

To add Sequin to an existing project's Docker Compose file, add a `sequin` service:

```yaml
services:
  ...
  sequin:
    image: sequin/sequin:latest
    ports:
      - "7376:7376"
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=postgres
      - PG_DATABASE=sequin
      - PG_USERNAME=postgres
      - PG_PASSWORD=postgres
      - REDIS_URL=<url>
      - SECRET_KEY_BASE=wDPLYus0pvD6qJhKJICO4dauYPXfO/Yl782Zjtpew5qRBDp7CZvbWtQmY0eB13If
      - VAULT_KEY=2Sig69bIpuSm2kv0VQfDekET2qy8qUZGI8v3/h3ASiY=
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
```
