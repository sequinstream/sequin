<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Run Sequin">
    The easiest way to run and test Sequin is with our Docker Compose file. This file starts a Postgres database, Redis instance, and Sequin server.

    Git clone the repository and run `docker compose up -d` in the `docker` directory:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
    cd sequin/docker
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    <Note>
    For more configuration options, including running Sequin on an existing Postgres and Redis instance or within an existing project, see our [Docker setup](/self-hosting/docker-setup).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to Sequin">
    After booting the Docker compose stack, open the Sequin console at [http://localhost:7376](http://localhost:7376):

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/setup-page.png" alt="Sequin setup page, indicating the database is connected and the instance is ready to use" />
    </Frame>

    Click the **Get started** button to provision a user and an account. On the login page, you can login with the default credentials:

    - email: `admin@sequinstream.com`
    - password: `sequinpassword!`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the playground database">
    <Tip>
      To help you try Sequin quickly, Sequin's Docker Compose file creates a logical database called `sequin_playground` with a sample dataset in the `public.users` table. Let's connect to it.
    </Tip>

    In the Sequin console, click **Connect Database** and then click the **Autofill with Connection String** button. Paste in the connection string for the `sequin_playground` database.

    ```bash
    postgresql://postgres:postgres@sequin_postgres:5432/sequin_playground?sslmode=disable
    ```

    The database comes pre-configured with a publication and replication slot. Give your database a name (i.e. `playground`) and click **Create Database**:

    <div className="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{padding: '56.25% 0 0 0', position: 'relative'}}>
      <div className="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style={{height: '100%', left: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, width: '100%'}}>
        <iframe
          src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/awrhv0r6ah?seo=false&videoFoam=true"
          title="connect-db Video"
          allow="autoplay; fullscreen"
          allowTransparency={true}
          frameBorder="0"
          scrolling="no"
          className="wistia_embed"
          name="wistia_embed"
          msallowfullscreen
          style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
        ></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

    <Check>
    You've connected the playground database!
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Sequence">
    Now, create a [Sequence](/how-sequin-works#sequences) to stream changes from the `public.users` table.

    Navigate to the **Sequences** tab and click the **Create Sequence** button.

    Select the `public.users` table. Then, select the column Sequin should use to order changes - in this case select the `updated_at` column:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-sequence.png" alt="Create Sequence" />
    </Frame>

    Click **Create Sequence**.

     <Check>
    You've created a sequence to stream changes from the `public.users` table!
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consume rows">
    Sequin is setup to stream rows from the `public.users` table. Now, consume rows from your sequence using the consume API, the sync API, or webhooks subscriptions.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Consume API">
        Navigate to the **Consume Endpoints** tab and click the **Create Endpoint** button.

        Select the the sequence you just created for the `public.users` table. Then click to add a filter to only capture rows where the `house_name` is `House Atreides`:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/setup-consume-endpoint-1.png" alt="Select filters" />
        </Frame>

        Now, indicate where the consumer should start. For this example, select **At the beginning of the table**.

        You can accept the default timeout, max ack pending, and max waiting for now (you can change these at any time).

        Finally, give your consumer group a name (i.e. `house_atreides_users`) and click **Create Consumer**:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-consumer-group.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        To try out your consume endpoint, make a call to the `receive` endpoint using the cURL command in the console:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "http://localhost:7376/api/http_pull_consumers/house_atreides_users/receive" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]"
       ```

       You'll immediately see a row returned in the console:

       ```json
       {
        "data": [
          {
            "data": {
              "record": {
                "house_name": "House Atreides",
                "id": 1,
                "inserted_at": "2024-10-23T23:56:28.348541",
                "name": "Paul Atreides",
                "updated_at": "2024-10-23T23:56:28.348541"
              }
            },
            "ack_id": "bf298c77-6d73-4598-8c89-9b2119558b59"
          }
        ]
       }
       ```

       You can then acknowledge the row using the `ack_id`. In this case:

       ```bash
       curl -X POST "http://localhost:7376/api/http_pull_consumers/house_atreides_users/ack" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"ack_ids": ["bf298c77-6d73-4598-8c89-9b2119558b59"]}'

       {"success":true}
       ```

       In the Sequin console, you can see the row in the **Messages** tab has been acknowledged:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/consumer-group-messages.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        Play around with the consume API to get a feel for how it works. Here are some `psql` commands to insert and update rows into the `public.users` table to generate more messages:

        ```bash Connect to the database
        # Connect to the Sequin PostgreSQL database
        psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:7377/sequin_playground?sslmod`e=disable
        ```

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash Insert user
        # Insert a new user into House Atreides
        "INSERT INTO public.users (house_name, name) VALUES ('House Atreides', 'Leto Atreides');"
        ```

        ```bash Update user
        # Update a user into House Atreides
        "UPDATE public.users SET house_name = 'House Atreides' WHERE id = 2;"
        ```

        ```bash Insert filtered out user
        # Insert a new user into House Harkonnen - this will be filtered out by our consume endpoint
        "INSERT INTO public.users (house_name, name) VALUES ('House Harkonnen', 'Baron Vladimir Harkonnen');"
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        <Check>
          You can now consume rows from your table!
        </Check>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Webhook subscriptions">
        Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click the **Create Subscription** button.

        Select the the sequence you just created for the `public.users` table. Then click to add a filter to only capture rows where the `house_name` is `House Atreides`:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/setup-consume-endpoint-1.png" alt="Select filters" />
        </Frame>

        Now, indicate where the consumer should start. For this example, select **At the beginning of the table**.

        You can accept the default timeout and max ack pending for now (you can change these at any time).

        Now, in the HTTP Endpoint section, you'll define the endpoint that Sequin will send webhook requests to. To get going quickly, click the **Create and use a new Webhook.site endpoint** button. This will generate a new HTTP endpoint on [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) that you can use for test purposes:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-http-endpoint.png" alt="Create webhook subscription" />
        </Frame>

        Finally, give your Webhook Subscription a name (i.e. `house_atreides_users`) and click **Create webhooks consumer**:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-webhook-subscription.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        Sequin will now send rows that match your filter to your endpoint. Open the **Messages** tab to see the rows that have been sent:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/webhook-messages.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        If you go back to the **Overview** tab, and click the **View on Webhook.site** button, you can see the raw webhook requests that were sent:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/webhook-dot-site.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        Play around with your webhook subscription to get a feel for how it works. Here are some `psql` commands to insert and update rows into the `public.users` table to generate more messages:

        ```bash Connect to the database
        # Connect to the Sequin PostgreSQL database
        psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:7377/sequin_playground?sslmod`e=disable
        ```

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash Insert user
        # Insert a new user into House Atreides
        "INSERT INTO public.users (house_name, name) VALUES ('House Atreides', 'Leto Atreides');"
        ```

        ```bash Update user
        # Update a user into House Atreides
        "UPDATE public.users SET house_name = 'House Atreides' WHERE id = 2;"
        ```

        ```bash Insert filtered out user
        # Insert a new user into House Harkonnen - this will be filtered out by our consume endpoint
        "INSERT INTO public.users (house_name, name) VALUES ('House Harkonnen', 'Baron Vladimir Harkonnen');"
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        <Check>
        Sequin is now sending rows from your table to your endpoint.
