<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Run Sequin" icon="server">
    The easiest way to run and test Sequin is with our Docker Compose file. This file starts a Postgres database, Redis instance, and Sequin server.

    1. Git clone the repository:

        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
        ```

    2. Navigate to the `docker` directory:

        ```bash
        cd sequin/docker
        ```

    3. Run `docker compose up -d`:

        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```

    4. Watch for the containers to start and verify they're running:

        ```bash
        docker compose ps
        ```

    <Note>
    For more configuration options, including running Sequin on an existing Postgres and Redis instance or within an existing project, see our [Docker setup](/self-hosting/docker-setup).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an account" icon="key">
    1. After booting the Docker compose stack, open the Sequin web console at [http://localhost:7376](http://localhost:7376):

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/setup-page.png" alt="Sequin setup page, indicating the database is connected and the instance is ready to use" />
        </Frame>

    2. Click the **Get started** button to provision a user and an account.
    3. On the login page, you can login with the default credentials:
        - Email: `admin@sequinstream.com`
        - Password: `sequinpassword!`

    <Check>
    You're running Sequin and logged in to the web console!
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the playground database" icon="database">
    <Tip>
      To help you try Sequin quickly, Sequin's Docker Compose file creates a logical database called `sequin_playground` with a sample dataset in the `public.regions` table. Let's connect to it.
    </Tip>

    1. In the Sequin web web console, click **Connect Database**.
    2. Click the **Autofill with Connection String** button and paste in the connection string for the `sequin_playground` database:
        ```bash
        postgresql://postgres:postgres@sequin_postgres:5432/sequin_playground?sslmode=disable
        ```

        The playground database comes pre-configured with a publication and replication slot so you can skip the end of the form.

    3. Click **Create Database**.

        <div className="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{padding: '56.25% 0 0 0', position: 'relative'}}>
          <div className="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style={{height: '100%', left: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, width: '100%'}}>
            <iframe

              title="connect-db Video"
              allow="autoplay; fullscreen"
              allowTransparency={true}
              frameBorder="0"
              scrolling="no"
              className="wistia_embed"
              name="wistia_embed"
              msallowfullscreen
              style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
            ></iframe>
          </div>
        </div>
        <script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

    <Check>
    You've connected the playground database!
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Sequence" icon="list">
    Now, create a [Sequence](/how-sequin-works#sequences) to stream changes from the `public.regions` table.

    1. Navigate to the **Sequences** tab and click the **Create Sequence** button.

    2. Select the `public.regions` table. Then, select the column Sequin should use to order changes - in this case select the `updated_at` column:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-sequence.png" alt="Create Sequence" />
        </Frame>

    3. Click **Create Sequence**.

     <Check>
    You've created a sequence to stream changes from the `public.regions` table!
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consume rows using webhooks" icon="webhook">
    Sequin is setup to stream rows from the `public.regions` table. Now, consume rows from your sequence using a webhook subscription.

    1. Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click the **Create Subscription** button.

    2. Select the the sequence you just created for the `public.regions` table.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/setup-webhook-source.png" alt="Select webhook source" />
        </Frame>

    3. Click to add a filter to only capture rows where the `timezone` is `pst`:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/set-webhook-filter.png" alt="Select filters" />
        </Frame>

    3. Jump ahead to the **HTTP Endpoint** section (you can use the defaults for the consumer starting point, message grouping, and configuration).

    4. Click the blue **Create and use a new Webhook.site endpoint** link:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-http-endpoint.png" alt="Create webhook subscription" />
        </Frame>

        This will generate a new HTTP endpoint on [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) that you can use for testing purposes.

    5. Finally, at the bottom of the form give your Webhook Subscription a name (i.e. `pst_regions`) and click **Create webhooks consumer**:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/create-webhook-subscription.png" alt="Consumer created" />
        </Frame>

        <Check>
        Sequin will now send rows that match your filter to your endpoint.
        </Check>

    6. Open the **Messages** tab to see the rows that have been sent:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/webhook-messages.png" alt="Messages" />
        </Frame>

    7. Click on one of the messages to see the delivery details including the logs for the message:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/message-logs.png" alt="Message logs" />
        </Frame>

    8. Go back to the **Overview** tab, and click the **View on Webhook.site** button to open the webhook.site dashboard:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/webhook-dot-site.png" alt="Webhook.site" />
        </Frame>

        <Check>
        You'll see that each message was delivered to the endpoint!
        </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert and update rows" icon="play">
    To learn how Sequin works, `insert` and `update` a couple of rows in the `public.regions` table:

    1. Open a terminal and connect to the `sequin_playground` database:

        ```bash
        psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:7377/sequin_playground?sslmode=disable'
        ```
    2. Create a new region in the `public.regions` table:

        ```bash
        INSERT INTO public.regions (name, timezone) VALUES ('us-gov-west-1', 'pst');
        ```

        This row matches the filter of your webhook subscription, so it will be delivered to your endpoint. You can verify this by checking the **Messages** tab in the Sequin web console:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/new-message-after-insert.png" alt="Messages tab" />
        </Frame>

    3. Update an existing region:

        ```bash
        UPDATE public.regions SET timezone = 'pst' WHERE id = 1;
        ```

        Again, this row also matches the filter of your webhook subscription, so it will be delivered to your endpoint.

    4. Finally, create a new region that doesn't match the filter:

        ```bash
        INSERT INTO public.regions (name, timezone) VALUES ('ca-west-1', 'mst');
        ```

        This row doesn't match the filter of your webhook subscription, so it won't be delivered to your endpoint. You can verify this by navigating to the **Databases** tab, selecting the `playground` database, and then clicking on the **Messages** tab:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/self-hosting/quickstart/filtered-out-message-trace.png" alt="Messages tab" />
        </Frame>

    <Check>
    You've learned how changes in your database flow through Sequin and how you can trace your messages end to end.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

You are running Sequin, connected to a playground database, and streaming rows as they change. Now that you have a feel for how Sequin works, you can tailor it to your needs by connecting to your own database, creating sequences, and consuming rows.
