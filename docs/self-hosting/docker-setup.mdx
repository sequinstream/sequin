You can run Sequin locally or self-host Sequin using Docker compose. Sequin requires:

- A Postgres database (for storing Sequin runtime configuration and message data)
- A Redis instance (for caching and assistance with message delivery)

## Docker compose

The easiest way to get started is to use the  `docker/docker-compose.yaml` file in the repository to start a Postgres instance, Redis instance, and Sequin server. This file uses a prod-ready version of Sequin.

Git clone the repository and run `docker compose up -d` in the `docker` directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
cd sequin/docker
docker compose up -d
```

## Advanced configuration

The Docker compose file contains a Postgres service that is configured to run on port 5432. It also contains a Redis service that is configured to run on port 6379. If you want to use your own existing Postgres database with Sequin instead of the bundled Postgres container, you can modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file as follows:

1. Remove the `postgres` service from the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
2. Update the `sequin` service environment variables to point to your Postgres database:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      - PG_DATABASE=<database>
      - PG_USERNAME=<username>
      - PG_PASSWORD=<password>
```

If you want to use your own existing Redis instance instead of the bundled Redis container, you can modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file as follows:

1. Remove the `redis` service from the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
2. Update the `sequin` service environment variables to point to your Redis instance:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=<url>
```

### Generating secrets

The `docker-compose.yaml` file contains placeholder values for the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `VAULT_KEY` environment variables. While these are OK to use for development, you should generate your own secrets for production environments.

To generate each secret, run the following command:

```bash
# SECRET_KEY_BASE
openssl rand -base64 32

# VAULT_KEY - make 'em different
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Docker compose with existing project

If you are adding Sequin to an existing `docker-compose.yaml` file in your project, you can add the following to the `services` section:

```yaml
services:
  ...
  sequin:
    image: sequin/sequin:latest
    ports:
      - "7376:7376"
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=postgres
      - PG_DATABASE=sequin
      - PG_USERNAME=postgres
      - PG_PASSWORD=postgres
      - REDIS_URL=<url>
      - SECRET_KEY_BASE=wDPLYus0pvD6qJhKJICO4dauYPXfO/Yl782Zjtpew5qRBDp7CZvbWtQmY0eB13If
      - VAULT_KEY=2Sig69bIpuSm2kv0VQfDekET2qy8qUZGI8v3/h3ASiY=
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
```

Make sure to configure the `PG_PORT` environment variable to match the port of your Postgres instance, usually `5432`.

### IPv6

Sequin supports IPv6 for Postgres and/or Redis connections. To enable IPv6, set the `PG_IPV6` and/or `REDIS_IPV6` environment variables to `true`:

```bash
PG_IPV6=true
REDIS_IPV6=true
```

## Telemetry

By default, the Sequin instance sends telemetry data to our servers. This data is anonymous and used to improve the product. If you would like to opt-out of this, you can set the `SEQUIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable in your `.env` file to `true`. For example:

```bash
SEQUIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
```
