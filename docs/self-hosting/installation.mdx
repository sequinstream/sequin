Sequin is composed of a server and a CLI. The server is best run as a Docker container. The CLI is a binary and is pre-compiled for most operating systems and architectures.

## Sequin server installation

You can install and start a Sequin server alongside Postgres so you can quickly get started. Alternatively, you can add Sequin to an existing `docker-compose.yaml` file in your project.

### Docker compose

The easiest way to get started is to use the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the repository to start a Postgres instance and Sequin server.

Git clone the repository and run `docker compose up -d` in the `docker` directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sequinstream/sequin.git
cd sequin/docker
docker compose up -d
```

The docker compose file contains a Postgres service that is configured to run on port 5432. If you want to use your own existing Postgres database with Sequin instead of the bundled Postgres container, you can modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file as follows:

1. Remove the `postgres` service from the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
2. Update the `sequin` service environment variables to point to your Postgres database:

```yaml
services:
  sequin:
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      - PG_DATABASE=<database>
      - PG_USERNAME=<username>
      - PG_PASSWORD=<password>
```

### Docker compose with existing project

If you are adding Sequin to an existing `docker-compose.yaml` file in your project, you can add the following to the `services` section:

```yaml
services:
  ...
  sequin:
    image: sequin/sequin:latest
    ports:
      - "7376:7376"
    environment:
      - PG_PORT=<port>
      - PG_HOSTNAME=postgres
      - PG_DATABASE=sequin
      - PG_USERNAME=postgres
      - PG_PASSWORD=postgres
      - SECRET_KEY_BASE=wDPLYus0pvD6qJhKJICO4dauYPXfO/Yl782Zjtpew5qRBDp7CZvbWtQmY0eB13If
      - VAULT_KEY=2Sig69bIpuSm2kv0VQfDekET2qy8qUZGI8v3/h3ASiY=
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

Make sure to configure the `PG_PORT` environment variable to match the port of your Postgres instance, usually `5432`.

## Schema

The stream tables that power Sequin are simple. Streams are stored in a Postgres schema called `sequin_streams` by default:

- `sequin_streams.messages`: Stores the messages for all streams. `messages` is partitioned by `stream_id`.
- `sequin_streams.consumer_messages`: Stores the state for consumers.

In addition, Sequin maintains several Postgres tables to support its internal operations. Those are stored in the `sequin_config` schema by default.

Sequin creates these schemas and tables for you.
