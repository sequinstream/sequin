When any setting is changed on a users account, you want to log the change. You might do this for compliance, for troubleshooting, auditing, or to enable an account history/timeline feature.

1. Sequin captures every `insert`, `update`, and `delete` on the `users` table.
2. It then allows you to combine this change with data from other tables to create a complete, full context audit log.
3. Then writes the change to the destination table of your choice.

This is a common "audit log" pattern.
