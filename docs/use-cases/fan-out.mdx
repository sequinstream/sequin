When a customer places an order, you need to update your inventory, schedule a shipment, and generate an invoice:

</Frame>

1. Sequin captures and streams every `insert` on your `orders` table using a durable replication slot.
2. It then delivers each row to the relevant service using Webhooks. Messages are retried until they are acknowledged by the service.
3. With a simple HTTP interface, replays, and observability built in you can easily scale this implementation.

This guide shows you how to implement fan outs with Sequin.

<Note>
  You could implement this pattern as a [side effect](/use-cases/side-effects) by sending a single message to a single service that then triggers multiple actions. However, by fanning out the order as unique messages you can ensure that each service is scaled and managed independently. You also gain the benefits of durable retries and observability for each service through Sequin.

## Implementation

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Connect your database to Sequin" icon="database">
    1. Login to your Sequin account and click the **Connect Database** button on the dashboard.
    2.  Paste the connection string for your database (or enter your connection credentials).
    3. Create a replication slot and publication for Sequin using the SQL commands in the console.
    4.  Name your database and click **Connect Database** to finish.

    <Check>
      Your database is now connected to Sequin. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).
    </Check>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup a WAL Pipeline" icon="timeline">
    Create a WAL pipeline to capture every order added to your database:

    1. Navigate to the **WAL Pipelines** tab and click **Create WAL Pipeline**.
    2. Select the `orders` table in the database you just connected to Sequin.
    3. In the **Operations to capture** section, only select `insert`.
    4. In the **Destination** section, click **+ Create new event table** and follow the instructions to add an event table to your database.
    5. Give your pipeline a name and click **Create WAL Pipeline**.

    <Check>
      Sequin will now capture every `insert` on the `orders` table and store it in your new events table.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Sequence" icon="list-ol">
    Add a Sequence to your `events` table to stream changes to your application:

    1. Navigate to the **Sequences** tab and click **Create Sequence**.
    2. Select the `events` table connected to your WAL pipeline. Sequin will automatically detect the correct columns to use for ordering.
    3. Click **Create Sequence**.

    <Check>
      Sequin is now set up to stream changes from your `events` table.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create three webhook subscriptions to fan out messages" icon="signal-stream">
    Create three [webhook subscriptions](/how-sequin-works#webhooks) (one for inventory, one for shipping, and one for invoicing) that deliver new orders to the relevant services:

    1. Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click **Create Subscription**.
    2. Select the `events` sequence you just created.
    3. Right now, you don't need to filter the messages you want to capture.
    4. In the next section, have the consumer group start **At the end of the table** so you only process new orders.
    5. Jump ahead to the **HTTP Endpoint** section and click to create a new endpoint. In the new window, enter the base URL for the relevant service and add any headers you need to authenticate the request. Then click **Create HTTPEndpoint**.
    6. Back in the Webhook Subscription window, click the refresh button and select the endpoint you just created. Add a specific path for your webhook (e.g. `/webhook/inventory`) if you need to.
    7. Name your webhook subscription and click **Create webhook subscription**.

    Repeat this process for the other two services.

    <Check>
      Sequin will now deliver new orders to your application using Webhooks.You could easily use [Consume API](/consume/consume-api/overview) to pull orders into your services as well.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle messages in each service" icon="code">
    Sequin is now capturing every `insert` on the `orders` table and fanning out messages to your HTTP endpoints:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO orders (
      order_id,
      customer_id,
      total_amount,
      shipping_address,
      status
    ) VALUES (
      'ORD-2024-1234',
      'CUST-789',
      149.99,
      '123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345',
      'PENDING'
    );
    ```

    Sequin will send the new orders to your webhook endpoints:

     ```json
    {
      "record": {
        "action": "insert",
        "changes": null,
        "committed_at": "2024-10-29T18:12:38.363829Z",
        "id": 1,
        "inserted_at": "2024-10-29T18:12:38.402773Z",
        "record": {
          "order_id": "ORD-2024-1234",
          "customer_id": "CUST-789",
          "total_amount": 149.99,
          "shipping_address": "123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345",
          "status": "PENDING"
        },
        "record_pk": "12",
        "seq": 1730225558363829,
        "source_database_id": "4ceb004f-9e5c-4688-9f9e-3453ee68e268",
        "source_table_name": "orders",
        "source_table_oid": 32784,
        "source_table_schema": "public"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "consumer": {
          "id": "5ae83088-8fac-492d-9c4d-73786808b01e"
        },
        "table_schema": "public",
        "table_name": "sequin_events"
      }
    }
    ```

    You can handle this message in your application. For instance, to schedule a shipment:

    ```js
    // Webhook handler for scheduling shipment
    app.post('/webhook/schedule-shipment', async (req, res) => {
      const { order_id, customer_id, shipping_address } = req.body.record.record;

      try {
        // Schedule shipment
        await scheduleShipment(order_id, customer_id, shipping_address);
        res.status(200).send('Shipment scheduled successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Error scheduling shipment');
      }
    });
    ```

    Importantly, to ensure that every new order is processed by each service, Sequin will retry the message until the HTTP request is acknowledged with a `200` status.
  </Step>

## Benefits

Fanning out events to multiple services has several benefits:

* **Asynchronous**: You can process events asynchronously without blocking your application.
* **Scalable**: You can easily scale this implementation with a simple HTTP endpoint.

Sequin handles the hard parts for you:

* **Transactional guarantees**: Sequin ensures that every new order is processed by each service.
* **Reliable retries**: Sequin will retry failed HTTP requests until they are acknowledged.
* **No custom infrastructure**: You don't need to run any custom infrastructure to send emails.
* **Observability**: You can easily see the status of your messages and re-send failed messages.
