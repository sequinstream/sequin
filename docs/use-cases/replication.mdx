When you update a product description, you might want to update your search index:

<Frame>

</Frame>

1. Sequin streams every row, as they change, from your `products` table.
2. It then delivers the rows to your search index.
3. With a simple HTTP interface, replays, and observability built in you can ensure the search index is always up to date.

This is a common replication pattern. This guide shows you how to implement replication with Sequin.

## Implementation

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Connect your database to Sequin" icon="database">
    1. Login to your Sequin account and click the **Connect Database** button on the dashboard.
    2.  Paste the connection string for your database (or enter your connection credentials).
    3. Create a replication slot and publication for Sequin using the SQL commands in the console.
    4.  Name your database and click **Connect Database** to finish.

      Your database is now connected to Sequin. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Stream" icon="list-ol">
    Add a Stream to your `products` table to stream rows to your search index:

    1. Navigate to the **Streams** tab and click **Create Stream**.
    2. Select the `products` table connected to your WAL pipeline.
    3. Select a column to use for ordering, like `updated_at`.
    3. Click **Create Stream**.

    <Check>
      Sequin is now set up to stream changes from your `products` table.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook Subscription" icon="webhook">
    Create a [Webhook Subscription](/how-sequin-works#webhooks) to deliver rows from your `products` stream to your search index (which you'll handle in the next step).

    1. Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click **Create Subscription**.
    2. Select the `products` stream you just created.
    3. Right now, you don't need to filter the messages you want to capture.
    4. In the next section, have the consumer group start **At the beginning of the table** so you can backfill your search index.
    5. Jump ahead to the **HTTP Endpoint** section and click to create a new endpoint. In the new window, enter the base URL for your application and add any headers you need to authenticate the request. Then click **Create HTTPEndpoint**.
    6. Back in the Webhook Subscription window, click the refresh button and select the endpoint you just created. Add a specific path for your webhook (e.g. `/webhook/search-index`) if you need to.
    7. Name your Webhook Subscription and click **Create Webhook Subscription**.

    <Check>
      You've set up a Webhook Subscription to deliver rows from your `products` stream to your application's endpoint.
    </Check>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Invalidate and update your search index" icon="file-magnifying-glass">
    Every time a row in your `products` table is updated Sequin will send a message to your webhook endpoint:

    ```json
    {
      "record": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "NVIDIA H-100 GPU",
        "description": "High-performance AI and HPC accelerator",
        "price": 30000.00,
        "in_stock": true,
        "compute_capability": "9.0",
        "memory_size_gb": 80
      },
      "metadata": {
        "table_schema": "public",
        "table_name": "products",
        "consumer": {
          "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
          "name": "search_index_consumer"
        }
      }
    }
```

    You can handle this message in your application and update your search index:

    ```js
    // Webhook handler for updating search index
    app.post('/webhook/update-search-index', async (req, res) => {
      const { record } = req.body;

      try {
        // Assuming you're using a hypothetical searchIndex object
        await searchIndex.upsert({
          id: record.id,
          name: record.name,
          description: record.description,
          price: record.price,
          in_stock: record.in_stock,
          compute_capability: record.compute_capability,
          memory_size_gb: record.memory_size_gb
        });

        res.status(200).send('Search index updated successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating search index:', error);
        res.status(500).send('Error updating search index');
      }
    });
    ```

    Importantly, to ensure that every product update is reflected in your search index, Sequin will retry the message until the HTTP request is acknowledged with a `200` status.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits

Sequin captures and streams every row, as they change, from your `products` table. You then use a simple webhook interface to update your search index to ensure it's always up to date.

Sequin handles the hard parts for you:

* **Transactional guarantees**: Sequin ensures that every change to your products is captured and sent to your search index.
* **Reliable retries**: Sequin will retry failed HTTP requests until they are acknowledged.
* **No custom infrastructure**: You don't need to run any custom infrastructure to send emails.
* **Backfill**: Sequin can replay the entire table to ensure your search index is up to date.
* **Replays**: Sequin can replay data from a specific point in time.
* **Observability**: Sequin provides observability into the replication process and the HTTP requests being sent.
