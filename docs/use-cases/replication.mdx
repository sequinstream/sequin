When you update a product description, you might want to update your search index:

</Frame>

1. Sequin captures every row on your `products` table using a durable replication slot.
2. It then delivers the changes to your search index.
3. With a simple HTTP interface, replays, and observability built in you can ensure the search index is always up to date.

This is a common replication pattern. This guide shows you how to implement replication with Sequin.

## Implementation

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Connect your database to Sequin" icon="database">
    1. Login to your Sequin account and click the **Connect Database** button on the dashboard.
    2. Paste the connection string for your database (or enter your connection credentials).
    3. Create a replication slot and publication for Sequin using the SQL commands in the console.
    4. Name your database and click **Connect Database** to finish.

      Your database is now connected to Sequin. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a webhook subscription to capture row changes" icon="signal-stream">
       Create a [webhook subscription](/how-sequin-works#webhooks) that captures every [row](/how-sequin-works#rows) in your `products` table:

    1. Click the **Create Consumer** button and then select the `users` table.
    2. Because you want to capture every row change you can leave the **Filter** field blank.
    3. Select the **Rows** option and then choose **Push** for the consumer type.

    <Note>
      By configuring the consumer to capture **Rows** Sequin will send a message for every row change in the table. You can also replay and backfill the entire table to ensure your search index is up to date.
    </Note>

    4. Enter the the HTTP endpoint where Sequin will send the changes. Add any headers you need to authenticate the request.
    5. Click **Create Consumer** to finish.

    <Check>
      Your consumer is now created. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).
    </Check>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Invalidate and update your search index" icon="file-magnifying-glass">
    Every time a row in your `products` table is updated Sequin will send a message to your webhook endpoint:

    ```json
    {
      "record": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "NVIDIA H-100 GPU",
        "description": "High-performance AI and HPC accelerator",
        "price": 30000.00,
        "in_stock": true,
        "compute_capability": "9.0",
        "memory_size_gb": 80
      },
      "metadata": {
        "table_schema": "public",
        "table_name": "house_atreides_members",
        "consumer": {
          "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
          "name": "dune_characters_consumer"
        }
      }
    }
```

    You can handle this message in your application and update your search index:

    ```js
    // Webhook handler for updating search index
    app.post('/webhook/update-search-index', async (req, res) => {
      const { record } = req.body;

      try {
        // Assuming you're using a hypothetical searchIndex object
        await searchIndex.upsert({
          id: record.id,
          name: record.name,
          description: record.description,
          price: record.price,
          in_stock: record.in_stock,
          compute_capability: record.compute_capability,
          memory_size_gb: record.memory_size_gb
        });

        res.status(200).send('Search index updated successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating search index:', error);
        res.status(500).send('Error updating search index');
      }
    });
    ```

    Importantly, to ensure that every product update is reflected in your search index, Sequin will retry the message until the HTTP request is acknowledged with a `200` status.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits

Sequin captures every change in your `products` table via the WAL and then ensure that each change is processed to update your search index. Sequin handles the hard parts for you:

* **Transactional guarantees**: Sequin ensures that every new order is processed by each service.
* **Reliable retries**: Sequin will retry failed HTTP requests until they are acknowledged.
* **No custom infrastructure**: You don't need to run any custom infrastructure to send emails.
* **Backfill**: Sequin can replay the entire table to ensure your search index is up to date.
* **Replays**: Sequin can replay data from a specific point in time.
* **Observability**: Sequin provides observability into the replication process and the HTTP requests being sent.
