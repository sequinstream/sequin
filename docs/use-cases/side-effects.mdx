When you insert a new user into your database, you might want to send them a welcome email:

</Frame>

1. Sequin captures and streams every `insert` on your `users` table using a durable replication slot.
2. It then delivers each row to the `sendWelcomeEmail` function using Webhooks. Messages are retried until they are acknowledged by the function.
3. With a simple HTTP interface, replays, and observability built in you can easily scale this implementation.

Here is how to implement side effects with Sequin.

## Example

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Connect your database to Sequin" icon="database">
    1. Login to your Sequin account and click the **Connect Database** button on the dashboard.
    2.  Paste the connection string for your database (or enter your connection credentials).
    3. Create a replication slot and publication for Sequin using the SQL commands in the console.
    4.  Name your database and click **Connect Database** to finish.

    <Check>
      Your database is now connected to Sequin. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).
    </Check>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup a WAL Pipeline" icon="timeline">
    Create a WAL pipeline to capture every new user added to your database:

    1. Navigate to the **WAL Pipelines** tab and click **Create WAL Pipeline**.
    2. Select the `users` table in the database you just connected to Sequin.
    3. In the **Operations to capture** section, only select `insert`.
    4. In the **Destination** section, click **+ Create new event table** and follow the instructions to add an event table to your database.
    5. Give your pipeline a name and click **Create WAL Pipeline**.

    <Check>
      Sequin will now capture every `insert` on the `users` table and store it in your new events table.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Sequence" icon="list-ol">
    Add a Sequence to your `events` table to stream changes to your application:

    1. Navigate to the **Sequences** tab and click **Create Sequence**.
    2. Select the `events` table connected to your WAL pipeline. Sequin will automatically detect the correct columns to use for ordering.
    3. Click **Create Sequence**.

    <Check>
      Sequin is now set up to stream changes from your `events` table.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook Subscription" icon="webhook">
    Create a [webhook subscription](/how-sequin-works#webhooks) to deliver rows from your `events` sequence to an endpoint in your application (which you'll handle in the next step).

    1. Navigate to the **Webhook Subscriptions** tab and click **Create Subscription**.
    2. Select the `events` sequence you just created.
    3. Right now, you don't need to filter the messages you want to capture.
    4. In the next section, have the consumer group start **At the end of the table** so you only send a welcome email to new users.
    5. Jump ahead to the **HTTP Endpoint** section and click to create a new endpoint. In the new window, enter the base URL for your application and add any headers you need to authenticate the request. Then click **Create HTTPEndpoint**.
    6. Back in the Webhook Subscription window, click the refresh button and select the endpoint you just created. Add a specific path for your webhook (e.g. `/webhook/new-user`) if you need to.
    7. Name your webhook subscription and click **Create webhook subscription**.

    <Check>
      You've set up a webhook subscription to deliver rows from your `events` sequence to your application's endpoint.
    </Check>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle messages in your application" icon="code">
    Sequin is now sending every `insert` on the `users` table to your HTTP endpoint. When a new user is inserted:

    ```sql
    insert into users (name, email) values ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
    ```

    Sequin will send the new user's information to your webhook endpoint:

    ```json
    {
      "record": {
        "action": "insert",
        "changes": null,
        "committed_at": "2024-10-29T18:12:38.363829Z",
        "id": 1,
        "inserted_at": "2024-10-29T18:12:38.402773Z",
        "record": {
          "email": "john.doe@example.com",
          "id": 12,
          "inserted_at": "2024-10-29T18:12:38Z",
          "name": "John Doe",
          "updated_at": "2024-10-29T18:12:38Z"
        },
        "record_pk": "12",
        "seq": 1730225558363829,
        "source_database_id": "4ceb004f-9e5c-4688-9f9e-3453ee68e268",
        "source_table_name": "users",
        "source_table_oid": 32784,
        "source_table_schema": "public"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "consumer": {
          "id": "5ae83088-8fac-492d-9c4d-73786808b01e"
        },
        "table_schema": "public",
        "table_name": "sequin_events"
      }
    }
    ```

    You can handle this message in your application and send a welcome email:

    ```js
    // Webhook handler for new user registration
    app.post('/webhook/new-user', async (req, res) => {
      const { name, email } = req.body.record.record;

      try {
        // Send welcome email
        await sendWelcomeEmail(name, email);
        res.status(200).send('Welcome email sent successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Error sending welcome email');
      }
    });
    ```

    Importantly, to ensure every new user receives an email, Sequin will retry the message until the HTTP request is acknowledged with a `200` status.

    <Check>
      You're set up to ensure every new user receives a welcome email!
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits

Implementing welcome emails as a side effect has several benefits:

* **Asynchronous**: Sending the email should not halt your application or the user.
* **Scalable**: You can easily scale this implementation with a simple HTTP endpoint.

Sequin handles the hard parts for you:

* **Transactional guarantees**: Sequin ensures that the email is sent for every new user. Even if a users is added to your database via a trigger or other means, Sequin will ensure the email is sent.
* **Reliable retries**: Sequin will retry failed HTTP requests until they are acknowledged.
* **No custom infrastructure**: You don't need to run any custom infrastructure to send emails.
* **Observability**: You can easily see the status of your messages and re-send failed messages.
