When you insert a new user into your database, you might want to send them a welcome email:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/use-cases/side-effects/send-with-sequin.svg" alt="Send welcome email with Sequin" />
</Frame>

1. Sequin captures every `insert` on your `users` table using a durable replication slot.
2. It then asynchronously queues and delivers messages to the `sendWelcomeEmail` function. Messages are retried until they are acknowledged by the function.
3. With a simple HTTP interface, replays, and observability built in you can easily scale this implementation.

This is a common "side effect" pattern. This guide shows you how to implement side effects with Sequin.

## Example

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Connect your database to Sequin" icon="database">
    1. Login to your Sequin account and click the **Connect Database** button on the dashboard.
    2.  Paste the connection string for your database (or enter your connection credentials).
    3. Create a replication slot and publication for Sequin using the SQL commands in the console.
    4.  Name your database and click **Connect Database** to finish.

      Your database is now connected to Sequin. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).
    </Check>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a consumer to captures `inserts` on the `users` table" icon="signal-stream">
       Create a [push consumer](/core-concepts#consumers) that captures [changes](/core-concepts#rows-and-changes) from the `users` table. It'll then send an HTTP request to your application with the new user's information (which you'll handle in the next step).

    1. Click the **Create Consumer** button and then select the `users` table.
    2. Because you want to capture every `insert` you can leave the **Filter** field blank.
    3. Select the **Changes** option and then choose **Push** for the consumer type.
    4. Enter the the HTTP endpoint where Sequin will send the changes. Add any headers you need to authenticate the request.
    5. Click **Create Consumer** to finish.

      Your consumer is now created. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle messages in your application" icon="code">
    Sequin is now capturing every `insert` on the `users` table and sending it to your HTTP endpoint. When a new user is inserted:

    ```sql
    insert into users (name, email) values ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
    ```

    Sequin will send the new user's information to your webhook endpoint:

    ```json
    {
      "record": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Chani",
        "title": "Fremen Warrior",
        "email": "chani@arrakis.gov",
        "spice_allocation": 500,
        "is_sayyadina": true
      },
      "changes": null,
      "action": "insert",
      "metadata": {
        "table_schema": "public",
        "table_name": "users",
        "commit_timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:00Z",
        "consumer": {
          "id": "e2f9a3b1-7c6d-4b5a-9f8e-1d2c3b4a5e6f",
          "name": "send_welcome_email_consumer"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    You can handle this message in your application and send a welcome email:

    ```js
    // Webhook handler for new user registration
    app.post('/webhook/new-user', async (req, res) => {
      const { name, email } = req.body;

      try {
        // Send welcome email
        await sendWelcomeEmail(name, email);
        res.status(200).send('Welcome email sent successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Error sending welcome email');
      }
    });
    ```

    Importantly, to ensuer every new user receives an email - Sequin will retry message until the HTTP request is acknowledged with a 200 status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits

Implementing welcome emails as a side effect has several benefits:

* **Asynchronous**: Sending the email should not halt your application or the user.
* **Scalable**: You can easily scale this implementation with a simple HTTP endpoint.

Sequin handles the hard parts for you:

* **Transactional guarantees**: Sequin ensures that the email is sent for every new user. Even if a users is added to your database via a trigger or other means, Sequin will ensure the email is sent.
* **Reliable retries**: Sequin will retry failed HTTP requests until they are acknowledged.
* **No custom infrastructure**: You don't need to run any custom infrastructure to send emails.
* **Observability**: You can easily see the status of your messages and re-send failed messages.
