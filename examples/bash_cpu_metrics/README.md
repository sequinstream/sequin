# Bash CPU Metrics

Monitor CPU metrics using Bash. Sends CPU load and CPU utilization metrics to a stream called `cpu_stats` by default.

This example is useful to generate a consistent stream of changing metrics. This is helpful for testing and development purposes or if you want to better understand how sequin works.

## Usage

```
./monitor.sh [stream]
```
